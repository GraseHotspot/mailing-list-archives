## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}It sounds like you may be restricting coupons to a single login at a time?
(Simultaneous-Use = 1). It's possible to have stale sessions have a hard
reset, which would be causing this problem. However, Freeradius will
usually pick up on the stale sessions within about 5 minutes of the reboot
occurring.

It may help know more about the coupons you are generating. Can you show
use the Group settings for the coupons?

Regards

Tim
