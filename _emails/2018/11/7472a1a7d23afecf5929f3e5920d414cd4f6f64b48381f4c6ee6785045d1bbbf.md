## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Mey be this helps:
https://medium.com/@lgobinath/no-ethernet-connection-in-ubuntu-16-04-linux-mint-18-with-realtek-rtl8111-8168-8411-7ae2779dc9b8

In that page there is a comment like this : "After spending an hour, I
found a proper fix. The problem was r8168 driver. The default driver
available in Ubuntu 16.04 PPA does not support Linux Kernel 4.13. Since
r8168 was not available, r8169 was used for Ethernet."
