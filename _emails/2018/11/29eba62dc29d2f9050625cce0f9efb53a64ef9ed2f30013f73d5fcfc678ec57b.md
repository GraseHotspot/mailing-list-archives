{% raw  %}Hey Sergen,

 

If memory serves GRASE is not capable of capturing https sites, only http, which is a question that Tim asked us back on the 28th of July 2018, I do not know what the result of the poll was, but that thread basically explains the issues with https tracking (if memory serves)  

 

Thanks

Subject: [GRASE-Hotspot] Squid3 Access.log

 

Hello there,

I've looked at the past issues a little, but I haven't found anything clear. Is it possible to see HTTPS Logs on Squid3 access.log?

In Squid.conf I have specified 3129 ports.

I let the chilli over. I made redirect on ipables but did not succeed. I can't get into HTTPS sites when I do this :)

I need to get the HTTPS logs. The size does not matter. Is there anyone who can help?
