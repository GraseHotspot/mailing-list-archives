## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Christopher

I was about to point you to the donations page, then I realised I had
forgotten to add that information! It's now there. (
https://grasehotspot.org/donations/)
If you had seen the patreon page, the numbers will appear different, as the
patreon page is in USD, and I work in AUD.

I've not yet got an easy way to display a "thermometer" of where we are at
with the recurring donations. At some point I'll see if I can get an easy
report out of stripe so we can display it.

Regards

Tim
