Hello Tim,

It would be nice for people to know what you would expect payment for a 
days work on grase to be.  I understand that you have to make sure that if 
you give up a day off your normal schedule that you would need to ensure 
that you had the money to cover that day, but sometimes people may not be 
able to give a regular amount, but you may well have the money required in 
one off payments to cover the day that particular month.

Regards,

Christopher.
