I would agree, and appreciate the effort, but I'm awaiting deployment
until two development features are finished:

1)  Up to date with the current LTS version of Ubuntu, which it requires.

2)  Self registration, which is the one feature it lacks in common with
its leading Windows competitor.

I'd really appreciate integration into the Ubuntu package repository,
but that carries #1 a whole lot further.
