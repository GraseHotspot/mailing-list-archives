{% raw  %}Hi, Tim:


Not a real serious problem, as noted below.  Just a couple of wishes.

 When you can get to it.  Payment portal and self registration go hand
in hand in reducing the overhead in signing up users.  If they can sign
themselves up, and pay for themselves, then there's no overhead beyond
machine time.

With wifi, you can't secure your medium.  Especially not public wifi.

My thinking, in broad strokes, would be that all traffic between user
and portal should be encrypted in some way.  It should take significant
computing resources to packet sniff, analyze, and decrypt a customer's
data stream, whether or not it contains personal or financial
information that needs protection.  Enable IPv6 fully, and you can do
that, but I'm not sure how that works from a user experience.

Until IPv6 is available, my $0.02 is that this needs a "hopefully sooner
rather than later" priority.  *Most* conventional business sites will
encrypt when the user goes to provide personal or financial information,
and the encryption runs from the user's browser to the information
recipient's server - for example, from me to my bank.  That's the
general purpose of SSL, and that's all well and good.   It doesn't cover
the user communicating with all sites, however, and I can think of
reasons why privacy would be important.
