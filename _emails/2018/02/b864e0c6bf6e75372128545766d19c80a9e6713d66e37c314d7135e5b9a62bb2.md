## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Sergen

We actually don't have any way to detect the difference between
someone turning off the Wifi, and not using a device. In theory, the
AP's know if we device is still connected, but we aren't the AP, we
don't have that data. Idletimeout is more critical to be low when
limiting people by time. That way, if they get disconnected, at the
most they'll use an extra "idletime" worth of time before they are
automatically logged out. If your users don't have time limits, then
you can increase the idletimeout much bigger.

Regards

Tim
