## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Charles

Payment portal integration & self registration need to wait until I
finish the PHP7/Symfony framework upgrades. They are #1 on the list at
the moment, as Ubuntu 12.04 is already out of general support, and
14.04 is out of support next year. So by the end of the year, we need
to support 16.04 and 18.04, which requires a PHP7 upgrade, which
requires the Symfony framework change. There are github issues for the
portal already.

Auto redirection with SSL. Not sure which way you are asking. If it's
redirecting SSL pages (i.e. someone tries to go to https://google.com,
and the captive portal redirects that), then that's not going to
happen. Due to how SSL works, this just isn't possible. It's also not
needed, as most modern browsers correctly detect captive portals
anyway. If you are asking that we make the login page SSL, that is
possible, but harder. It requires that we have a public IP address and
hostname that we can get a certificate for. Even with Letsencrypt,
this is still more difficult to automate and setup out of the box.
Hopefully in the future we can make this easier to do, with clear
instructions.
However, what you may not realise, is that even without SSL, we are
already pretty secure on the login page. This is because we do CHAP
authentication, (assuming you don't disable the JS login), which
ensures the password isn't ever sent over the wire, only the CHAP
challenge and response. (This is also the reason the password is in
clear-text in the database, no other way to do CHAP).

Hope that gives you the information you needed.

Regards

Tim
