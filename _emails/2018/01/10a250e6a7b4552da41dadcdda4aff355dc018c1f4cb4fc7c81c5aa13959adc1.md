## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

Some or most of our users are actually not techy and to mention also that 
about 30% of personnel are aged 50++ that's why most of our systems are 
adjusted to be more efficient although they are considered running "less 
secured".

I can make the passwords to lowercase/uppercase on DB side. Im still trying 
to dig deeper on uam and radmin JS files to locate where i can modify to 
ensure conversion of password to specific case before doing authentication. 
Honestly, im not so good yet on http docs including on JS that's why i 
found it quite hard to modify something.. xD

Thanks by the way,
Gerard
