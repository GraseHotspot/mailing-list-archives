Hi Bob,
Thanks for the info Sir. We are now setting up multiple AP using cables as 
this will be the cheapest way we could at least do. :)

cheers,
Gerard

Hi Dražen,
 Thanks for the very informational setup diagram that you provide. We 
cannot afford WDS setups though as good WDS-capable AP are extremely 
expensive in our country. I have noted all your shared info and it will 
surely help me a lot on my next network projects. Grase is the best network 
solution i could always run to.

Cheers and more power,
Gerard
