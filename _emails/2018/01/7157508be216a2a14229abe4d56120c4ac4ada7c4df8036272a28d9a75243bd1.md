## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Gerard

Due to how CHAP auth works, you need to modify the databases to all be
stored in a consistent case (i.e. lower case), and then in the JS
ensure that you lowercase the password before doing CHAP auth on it.

By default, the generated passwords should be lower case, are you
having particular issues with the case sensitivity? Forcing things to
be case insensitive is technically reducing the security of the
system.

Regards

Tim
