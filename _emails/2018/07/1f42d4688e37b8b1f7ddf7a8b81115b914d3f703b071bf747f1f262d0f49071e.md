## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Shirish,

Using a layer-2 wifi mesh network as your distribution architecture should
allow roaming like you want. I use Atheros devices with firmware from
VillageTelco <http://download.villagetelco.org/firmware/secn/> but a
managed solution like OpenMesh <https://www.openmesh.com/products/wifi>
would be cheap and simple to implement.

Cheers,

Bob
