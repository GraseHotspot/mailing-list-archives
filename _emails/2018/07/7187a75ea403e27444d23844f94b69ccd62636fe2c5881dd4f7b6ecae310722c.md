## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello all,

I have a installation in Hotel where I have 3 AP each on 5 floors ie total 
15 APs in bridge mode with no WEP key and DHCP disabled and same SSID to 
all APs.
Grase Hotspot gives IP to the mobiles after they connect to open APs. I 
have created group for hotel guests with 48 hrs time 5 MBPS speed and 5GB 
quota and Timeout Disable.

customer can connect with voucher, but if they move from one AP to other 
they are not getting reconnected to 2nd or 3rd AP. if they come back to 1st 
AP they can connect.
If they disable WIFI on mobile and enable again they can connect but have 
to relogin.

I am not getting seamless connectivity across all APs. what could be the 
problem.

I want seamless connectivity, once user enters ID and Password it should 
remain connected for 48 hours. Even if the customer goes out and comes back 
he should be reconnected based on MAC ID.

can some one help to resolve the issue.

Tim : MAC ID binding is highly required feature. I am waiting for 3 years 
for this feature to be incorporated in grase. When grase ver 4 is expected ?

Shirish
