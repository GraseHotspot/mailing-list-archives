Subject: [GRASE-Hotspot] "Patreon" supporting!

 

As promised at the start of the year, I would investigate Patreon and alternatives so that people can regularly support me to work on the Grase Hotspot.

 

The donations page (https://grasehotspot.org/donations/) has now been updated with links to Patreon, a bitcoin address, paypal details, and now, Stripe donations!

 

The stripe form allows both once off and monthly donations, so if you want to "patreon" support me for the lowest fee's, Stripe is the answer! I'll even give them the same perks a patreon support would get.

 

If we can get enough regular support, I can start trading a normal "day job" work day a month to work on the hotspot. The more support, the more time I can work on it!

 

I'm still hopeful to have the PHP 7 rewrite version out before the end of the year, so fingers crossed we can keep moving forwards!


Regards

 

Tim
