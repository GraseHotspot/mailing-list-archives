## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}The radpostauth table is the one that grows large. It was fixed in 3.7.7.8.
Is there any reason you haven't upgraded to a newer version?
You can see the difference between your current version and 3.7.7.8 at
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/compare/3.7.7.6...3.7.7.8

Ideally, if you can upgrade, that would help. Otherwise you'll need to
manually keep the radpostauth table under control. (Also, because it's
grown, truncating it won't free up disk space, but will improve
performance. The MySQL DB can't ever shrink, but it will stop growing).

Regards

Tim
