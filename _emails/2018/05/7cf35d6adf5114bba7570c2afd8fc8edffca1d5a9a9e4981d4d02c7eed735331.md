## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Postaemre

Because we do CHAP authentication, the plaintext password the user types in
is never sent to the server. A CHAP challenge and response is, which isn't
reversible to see what the client typed in. Unfortunately for your use
case, you can never get the plaintext password that the user typed in.

Regards

Tim
