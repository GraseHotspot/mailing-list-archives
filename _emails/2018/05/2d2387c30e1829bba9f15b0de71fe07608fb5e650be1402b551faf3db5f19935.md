## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim

Users sometimes write their passwords incorrectly. I can see incorrect 
access requests from the RADPOSTAUTH table, but I can not see what they are 
doing when writing the password. Plain text passwords do not go to the PASS 
field. Only the CHAP-Password value is written here. Sometimes it is useful 
to tell users that HOTSPOT is working, but they have entered the wrong 
password and even the mistake they have made is that.

In the /etc/freeradius/sql.conf file and 
/etc/freeradius/sql/mysql/dialup.conf, I saw the sql lines that sent values 
for the RADPOSTAUTH table.

I've done experiments in these areas. I created a new column. I wanted to 
print the plain password value here, but again I realized that the value 
was empty.

Can you help me?

Thank you...
{% endraw %}
