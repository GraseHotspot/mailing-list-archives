## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}That USB adapter could be a problem, how well is recognised by linux if
ever at all. I tried a couple of them. My previous configuration was
running on Dell Latitude 5xxx with some dualcore intel, with adapter on
USB2 for several years achieving 100MBps only. It was hosting in season
tens of devices over 3 or 4 APs. Until it died. I could measure router
speed on any point. But to be honest most APS or routers before or even
today have no ethernet port faster than 100MBps.
Main problem with using the laptop was the electric power break. I never
had a laptop which can be set to power on back after the electric comes
back.
Here is my early work photo documented. It was one HP Compaq 6xx:
