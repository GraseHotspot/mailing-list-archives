## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}In fact speed problem could  be related to Grase very tightly. Since Grase
has very clear parameter to define download and upload speed for each
group.
User asking a help gave just a portion of information which leads in
probably wrong direction. It is not easy to offer correct help without
getting more information.
I don't understand why such nervous reaction regarding this topic. This
group was always quite helpful and pollaid.
Regards, Drazen
