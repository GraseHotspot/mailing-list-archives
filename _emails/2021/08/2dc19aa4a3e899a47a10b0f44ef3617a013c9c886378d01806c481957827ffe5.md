## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Just configured Ubuntu 18.04 on a hyper-v vm, 2 lan cards hen followed the 
instructions to install, everything appears to go fine until first-run, 
when I'm prompted with the attached screenshot, has anyone had this or know 
where I might be going wrong?

Many thanks
{% endraw %}
