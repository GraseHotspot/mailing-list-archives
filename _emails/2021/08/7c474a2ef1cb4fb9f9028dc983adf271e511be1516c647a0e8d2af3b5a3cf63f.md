## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Gert

All the code (and packages) are on github. As was posted a few months back (
https://groups.google.com/a/grasehotspot.org/g/grase-hotspot/c/QOaPnxI6bWs)
development has currently been put on hold.

You have already discovered that the stable version (3.8) only runs on
older Ubuntu versions. V4 was released as a beta release last year, and
runs on at least 18.04, and probably 20.04. Have a look at
https://grasehotspot.org/documentation/v4-nightly-builds for how to get
started with the V4 beta builds.

I have no intention of shutting down the apt repo's, or letting the domain
expire (the risk for a squatter to get the domain and to try and do
something malicious is too high). If I have the time in the future then
I'll keep working on V4, and updating it for Ubuntu 20.04 and future LTS
versions.

Regards

Tim
