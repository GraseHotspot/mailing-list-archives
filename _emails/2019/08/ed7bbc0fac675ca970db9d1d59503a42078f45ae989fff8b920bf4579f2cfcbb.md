Well, if it were entirely software based, no.

From my perspective:

1)   I just tried to do a fresh install.  Ubuntu no longer has any of
the version 14.04 package repository available, as the OS version is now
retired.  The fresh install is going to be quite problematic if I cannot
access the package repository from 14.04.

2)  The underlying dependencies (coova-chili and the rest) as required
are also unmaintained versions dating from *prior to* 2014.  In other
words, the underlying dependencies are now also abandoned.

3)  Michael is using a development framework dating from 2014 (or
earlier).  As I understand it, he needed/needs to update that to go with
a change implemented by Canonical in version 16.04 (three years ago).  
We've been waiting for *that* update since 2016, three years ago.   It
hasn't happened yet.

4)  Everything is set up as open software, so developing a derivative
package that bundles everything together is permitted, and the source
code is also freely available.

5) Canonical has designated 19.04 as worthy of the LTS designation.  So
now we have either one of two mileposts to achieve - update to 18.04, or
update to 19.04.  Bundling everything as one package without
dependencies would be a MAJOR added bonus, as it could then be
distributed through the package repositories.

6)  My present platform is now generating warning messages from the lack
of hardware support caused by the retirement of Ubuntu 14.04.

From what I understand, the project does not pay well enough to be
maintained.  Am I correct so far?

Charlie
