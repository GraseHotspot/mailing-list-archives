At the point I can build an 18.04 package, I'll upgrade Coova Chilli to the
latest version. Each version changes things slightly, so trying to rebuild
Coova Chilli for a new image takes a considerable amount of time.

I did start down the track of doing the least work possible to run on PHP
7. Unfortunately for the database side of things we relied on a PEAR DB
library, which was a great idea back them before PDO existed, and was the
worst idea for trying to move to PHP 7. So by the time you rip out that
layer and replace it with something modern, you've replaced all the
important logic anyway. Then you discover that the templating engine also
doesn't play with PHP 7 nicely, so you rip that out and suddenly you have a
brand new application. Essentially, without trying to run a really old
version of PHP on 18.04 (I'm not going to try and package PHP 5 for 18.04),
we're stuck in the "rewrite" we're in. Any code that can be reused has been
reused, but all the database and template code has to be redone on a modern
library, so the Symfony framework is a freebie that comes with that.

Most of the dependencies we relied on previously didn't exist in Ubuntu, or
like Coova Chilli were old versions. Anytime I don't have to package a
dependency and can use Ubuntu's I will.

What kind of self registration? There is already the "free account" button
that allows devices to get a "free" account based on a group (so
restrictions are applied). I also have some patches I've done over the
years that aren't good enough to make it into the release (hacky patches)
that would help you get started with other registration methods (like
needing to provide name/email first).

I want to just say Thankyou for asking the question. I'm not great at
giving updates until asked, so it's good to get the prompt to give an
update. It also gives me another chance to see what the community interest
is like. People asking for updates and still wanting to use it, that helps
me know that it's still wanted. No point developing something that's not
still wanted, especially when I see other solutions out there that are
"good enough" for some people.

Maybe I can work out an interim solution of PHP5 on 18.04, I'll have a play
around with it in the near future. But it'll be 'unsupported', best effort
kind of thing (especially as it'll involve installing a PPA to get it
working).
