## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Yeah, well, I'm trying to find an alternative to FirstSpot.  $700 per site
is a bit much, and I would need to acquire a new computer to run it on.

I'm not so concerned with security as I am reliability and performance.

I'm attempting a change in hardware that is going to require a new
install.  The new install is problematic.  I'm installing on a box with one
USB wifi adapter, and a built in ethernet attached to a wifi access point.

The base install went fine off of DVD.  My first step after an install is
to install ssh, so that I can configure from somewhere else on the LAN.
 The 14.04 package repository is no longer available (according to
packages.ubuntu.com), so installing ssh failed.

I haven't tried old-releases.ubuntu.com yet.  I've set up a private mirror
of the current Ubuntu package and cd image repositories, but I haven't
tried installing off of them yet.  It's on the same computer.

Interesting. It does appear that Coova Chilli hasn't had a release since

See above.

My bust.  I'm *terrible* with names <g>.

That IMHO is the most important piece to complete.  Even if the rest does
not change, getting to a point that it works on at least 18.04 is simply
the most important step in the process.

Ultimately it should finish up as the package, dependencies as drawn off of
the Ubuntu repositories, and customization after that.  I haven't look at
package architecture in quite some time, but IIRC it's possible to install
the base package, draw and install the dependencies off the Ubuntu
repository, and then draw custom configuration files out of your archive.
I'll see what I can find.  Intricate, but done once.

5) Canonical has designated 19.04 as worthy of the LTS designation.  So now
we have either one of two mileposts to achieve - update to 18.04, or update
to 19.04.  Bundling everything as one package without dependencies would be
a MAJOR added bonus, as it could then be distributed through the package
repositories.

This is news to me. 18.04 has the LTS tag, I've not seen anything about

I  take it back.  16.04 (LTS), 18.04(LTS), 18.10, and 19.04 the four major
versions with packages available.  https://packages.ubuntu.com/

Not really.  The only one by comparison is FirstSpot.  It's $700 per site,
and it requires Windows.

I have no particular problem with supporting the upgrade to 18.04, if the
rest of the community can get behind it as well.  If I'm viewing the
project correctly, you're looking at two months FTE to bring it current,
and I can't see being the only one to support the entire upgrade.

Bear in mind, I haven't deployed it yet, and as I work with it I get closer
to deployment.  *THE* big holdup is a lack of self-registration.

I'll take my pique as impatience, and accept your response as chiding.
