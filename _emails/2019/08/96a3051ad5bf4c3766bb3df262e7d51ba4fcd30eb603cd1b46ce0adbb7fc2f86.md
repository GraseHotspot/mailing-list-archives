## Raw message

```
{% raw  %} Hello, 
 
I suggest that you ssh into the server if you are able to do so remotely, 
and go into /var/run and see if there is a chilli.eth3.pid file in there 
and delete it.  Of course your eth number *may* be different, but this is 
the "run" number for coova chili, and deleting it will make no difference.  
Hello,

and delete it.  Of course your eth number *may* be different, but this is 
the "run" number for coova chili, and deleting it will make no difference.
 
The only other thing I can think of, is that somehow or other, during the 
unexpected shutdown due to lack of power, there is the possibility that the 
mysql database has become corrupted. 
 
You will need to use mysqlcheck to see if the database itself needs to be 
repaired.
 
Make sure that when deleting the .pid file, that you do so as root.  If on 
Ubuntu itself, you will need to do sudo rm -rf chilli.ethx.pid, where "x" 
is the number of the network card.
 
Regards,
 
Christopher.
