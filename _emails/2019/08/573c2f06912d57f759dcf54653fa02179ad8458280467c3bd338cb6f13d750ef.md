## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}And I generally agree.  I'm paying to accomplish an upgrade that
resuscitates a dead package.  My request for an additional feature is a
*request*.  Tim may not be able to grant it given the project requirements.

Any of the rest of the community wants to pitch in, then they can certainly
submit *requests*.   Otherwise, two people are saving the package from
extinction.

Charlie
