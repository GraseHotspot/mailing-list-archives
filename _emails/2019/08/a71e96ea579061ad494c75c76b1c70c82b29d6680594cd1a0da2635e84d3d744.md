## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Please do not misunderstand me. It is your natural right to ask for the new
update.
But there's one thing I don't understand. If such a system is running well,
if there is no problem, should there be an continuous update to that system?
Please do not consider this system as a normal server or desktop operating
system. It's a closed-loop system. Users do not have the right to make many
changes to the system. They cannot upload files. No FTP accounts. No
database users, no one makes query. A closed main system for users.

We are not claiming that we have a full-featured firewall. We don't have
security systems like PFsense that require constant updates.
Using Grase, we only provide simple and easy internet access.

I think of my modem. It didn't receive a firmware update for years, but
it's still working.

Would it be too wrong to look at it in this way?
