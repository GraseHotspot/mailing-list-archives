## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Chris:

Tim and I are exchanging emails off list.

Tim is committing to delivering an updated project sometime in the first
quarter, 2020 (January/February), given the proposed  funding level (two
donors, $200 AUD a month per donor) for a projected cost of $2000 AUD for
the upgrade.

We're discussing feature requests.  I want something a bit more insistent
regarding registration, compatibility with (installs under) 18.04, and self
registration (end user to GRASE) with a payment portal.

Reply to this off list if you need further details.

Charlie
