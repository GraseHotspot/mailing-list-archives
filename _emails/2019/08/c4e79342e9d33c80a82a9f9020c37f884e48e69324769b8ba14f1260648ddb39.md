## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim,

As it seems that there may well be another person, other than your regular 
donor who seems to be willing to make a contribution, I am asking you, if 
you had donations that covered 2 full days per month, how long would it 
take you to actually be able to finish your own internal code upgrades to 
the point of being able to upgrade to the 18.x version of Ubuntu?  What I 
am in essence asking, is, with two days of payment per month, how many 
months would it take you to reach that goal?

I am seriously looking at giving $200 au per month, and if one or more 
others could come up with the second day, that would give everyone, 
including yourself a better idea. 

Regards,

Christopher.
{% endraw %}
