## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Sunny

There is lots of work before Grase can be deployed in Docker. Lots of
interconnecting parts. Currently, I have a docker image that is used for
the online demo (https://github.com/GraseHotspot/Demo-Docker) which cheats
a little. It's good to run the demo, but won't work for production. Once we
get microservices happening, we can dockerise Grase nicely.

Regards

Tim
