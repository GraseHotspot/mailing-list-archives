## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Dir Daniel.
I have many problems with my server and i know that the non updated
software is causing more problems than the Grace is giving as sollutions.
I feel really sad but i think on some point i have to search too for an
alternative solution. I have donated 2-3 times, i wish i could do more.
I really like Grace a lot and the new versions would have some really great
features, but the question is how many of us are still using Grace and if
we can support it with donations.
