## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I, for one, would hope this continues.  I'm awaiting the update to 18.04
because then it's supported for five years within the OS, as was the
release that coincided with Ubuntu 14.04.

I'm not sure compatibility with Debian should be as important as
compatibility with Ubuntu.  Not to start a flame war, but IMHO Ubuntu and
its additional three rounds (testing, unstable, and stable) makes for a
better quality OS.  Besides, Ubuntu commits to a 5-year support period for
the LTS versions, which (IMHO again) are more stable.

So long as the current version will install, let's be patient.
