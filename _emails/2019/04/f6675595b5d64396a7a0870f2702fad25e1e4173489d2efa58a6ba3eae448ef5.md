{% raw  %}Hey Charles,

 

I had similar questions, my system was setup I think the way you want it, although I did use a secondary system to share the files. 

 

I made the apache server redirect to the grase login screen (I cannot remember the code right now as I set it up 3 years ago now) and just used the portal customization option to share a link to the shared file location that I shared using  lighttpd. I hope this helps and that I understood your question correctly.

There's also a posting from 2014'ish about how to set up a central admin location and satellite hot spot locations.  That posting was far too intricate, but I'll accept anyone's ideas.  All I'm looking to do is to share the admin login screen with a workstation elsewhere on the network, such as a cash register terminal.

Second question:  Is it possible to make a file directory on the server accessible to all, without any time or download limits, either with or without a free access account assigned to access it?  Let's suppose I wanted to make a directory of software freely available to all, with or without an account.  Is it possible?

I can buy that.  

How would I disable the default apache server login page, so that someone can't probe from inside the network and find the machine?

Unfortunately, the system does not work this way. By its nature, the Captive Portal system only examines and directs requests from the LAN port. If you can put a firewall before Grase wan port, capturing the traffic will be easier .

I notice that browsing to the Hotspot machine from *within* the network
gets a default Apache page.  Is it possible to capture browsing traffic
from *within* the network?

For example, my hotspot is currently at 192.168.0.14 as it connects to
my Internet router.  If I  use a different machine on the internal
network to browse to 192.168.0.14, I get a default Apache page.  How
would I change the Apache configuration on the hotspot machine to get
the Hotspot login screen?
