## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi All

Just a quick message. If you're experiencing DNS issues with your clients,
and you can see lines in the syslog such as:
coova-chilli[1532]: dhcp.c: 1784: dropping malformed DNS

It appears to be an issue with older versions of Coova Chilli. It should be
fixable by modifying /etc/chilli/config from something like:

# OpenDNS Servers
#HS_DNS1=208.67.222.222
#HS_DNS2=208.67.220.220
HS_DNS2=$HS_UAMLISTEN
HS_DNS1=$HS_UAMLISTEN

To something like:
# OpenDNS Servers
HS_DNS1=208.67.222.222
HS_DNS2=208.67.220.220
#HS_DNS2=$HS_UAMLISTEN
#HS_DNS1=$HS_UAMLISTEN

Make sure to replace the DNS server IP's with DNS servers you are happy to
use. Then reboot.

This /should/ bypass CoovaChilli code for DNS requests (and also will
bypass dnsmasq) from clients, which should at least get things running.

We'll be compiling a newer version of Coova Chilli for V4, so hopefully
this will be a non issue then.

Regards

Tim
