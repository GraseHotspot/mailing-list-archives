## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I'm not sure why you're trying to capture it. As long as you don't allow it
to generate the 204, then it'll work as intended. It's how Google checks if
it's behind a captive portal. If it doesn't get a valid connection to it,
then it'll assume the wifi doesn't work, or it's behind a captive portal.
The http version of it should automatically get the 302 redirect. Are you
seeing HTTPS requests?
