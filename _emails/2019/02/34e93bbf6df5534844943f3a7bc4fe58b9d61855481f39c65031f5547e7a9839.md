## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello,

I currently installed GRASE Hotspot on my Xubuntu 14.04 machine.  The 
problem is it doesn't show the captive portal on the connected.  The 
connected device shows that it is connected to GRASE hotspot because the IP 
address is 10.1.0.X while its gateway and DNS is 10.1.0.1.

I already removed the network manager. I checked the system status and all 
services are up and running. Also the system works on Debian 7 in the same 
PC.

Regards,
Sunny
