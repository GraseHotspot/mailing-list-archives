Thanks Lester for response,

I have decreased the lease time to 14400 as suggested and am running a test 
now to see how it goes.

What do you mean by how many session per day?

However my DHCP scope is 192.168.64.0/18 start: 10 end: 254 (127.254) which 
will generate about 16,000 IPs, which my current establishment cannot use 
up in the mean time.
