## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hey,

 

I have my dhcp set to 300 (which is 5 minutes) I find this works fine, and when my clients have an issue (such as their device links and drops the connection but the client remains logged in) all I need tell them to do is switch the device off (or disable wifi) for 5 minutes, and this sorts most issues.   I used to have an issue with dhcp leases just running out, turned out I had a faulty network card (haven’t a clue how that affected the system, but when I replaced the card, the issue went away)

 

Also (after further consideration of your images) maybe specify in your dhcp range instead of “start 10” and “end 254” try “start 64.10” and “end 127.254” (I hope that is the correct end point, I only ever use class c 255.255.255.0 networks and have not really remembered my subnetting)
