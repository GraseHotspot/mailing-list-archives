The session report will show the total amount, and the www/http traffic. 
IIRC it has the total amount in brackets? (Can't check atm).
The total amount is calculated from the radius sessions, in the radius 
radacct table. The www/http amount is calculated from the Squid logs.
The only way to get a full listing of protocols, is some pretty 
complicated traffic accounting setups, which I have investigated and the 
system resources it consumes is just not worth it. If you are interested 
in it, look around for linux traffic accounting packages, there are a 
few around (although the simpliest may just be some firewall rules to 
categorise some of the traffic into protocols, and lump the rest into a 
single rule).

Sorry I can't help you more. IIRC Windows updates used to be over http, 
but that may have changed. Things like bittorrent can be seen very 
obviously sometimes when a user has a few Gb's downloaded and no web 
traffic! Maybe your customer is using a VPN? Companies often force the 
use of a VPN.
