Hi Wes, have you managed to work this out yet?

I believe a change to mime-support has broken it. Can you give me the 
output of 'grep php /etc/mime.types'

Thanks. Also, what version of linux are you using?

I need to find a solution, as apparently it was a bug fix to 
mime-support that has broken a number of packages! Ah!
