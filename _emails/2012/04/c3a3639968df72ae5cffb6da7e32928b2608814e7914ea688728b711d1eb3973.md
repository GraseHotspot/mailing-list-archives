## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Aan.
This is an odd error. You'd assume if it was dnsmasq that was the 
problem, then bypassing that would fix it. Given that other things don't 
have the problem, this sounds like a squid problem. Maybe you have UDP 
packet issues? I'd try things like increasing squid timeout for DNS. 
It's also possible that the upstream DNS server is having problems.

What Squid version are you using? You can disable the use of squid 
(remove the transparent proxy firewall rules) if it's a big issue, but 
you loose the logging of what users goto and the caching.
