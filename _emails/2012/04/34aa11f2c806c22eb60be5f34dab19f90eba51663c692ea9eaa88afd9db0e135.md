## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello, I recently updated to gnome 3 shell, which I think broke many
packages on my system. I had a fully working grase-hotspot setup before
anyhow. Now all the sudden any client gets redirected to
10.1.0.1/grase/uam/hotspot/ like they're supposed to, but its not being
found. And I can login as admin, but all links inside admins page are
broken and also not being found.
Trying to chase down the problem if anyone can give me some good leads.
{% endraw %}
```
