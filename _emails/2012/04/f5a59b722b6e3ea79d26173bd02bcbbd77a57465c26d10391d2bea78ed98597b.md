## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thanks for the response.

i'm using squid3
how to check if i have issue with UDP packet?
thing i know is:
1. download or chat --> ok, there is no problem at all.
2. browsing --> sometimes give error "DNS timeout" with squid logo. 

the thing i have tried:
1. disable dnsmasq and baypassing it --> didn't work
2. reinstall my ubuntu and fresh install grase --> it work for a week now with rarely error.

but like to try how to disable the use of squid, just in case the problem still occur in a near future.
Thanks

Hi Aan.
This is an odd error. You'd assume if it was dnsmasq that was the
    problem, then bypassing that would fix it. Given that other things
    don't have the problem, this sounds like a squid problem. Maybe you
    have UDP packet issues? I'd try things like increasing squid timeout
    for DNS. It's also possible that the upstream DNS server is having
    problems.

What Squid version are you using? You can disable the use of squid
    (remove the transparent proxy firewall rules) if it's a big issue,
    but you loose the logging of what users goto and the caching.
