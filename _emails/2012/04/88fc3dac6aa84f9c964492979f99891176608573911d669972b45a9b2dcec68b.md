## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}David.
Had you set the correct interfaces in the hotspot interface (and saved it)?
And no point should it be overriding static settings and turning it in 
to dhcp. Did you by any chance have NetworkManager managing the interface?
It sounds like eth0 didn't have an ip address, so grase assumed it was 
the interface for lan, it starts up its dhcp listening on eth0 which 
happens to get the eth0 dhclient requests, so ends up assigning eth0 an 
ip (and gateway) from it's lan pool!

Just make sure in the interface that eth0 is set to wan and eth1 is set 
to lan, and save it to ensure the settings have actually been saved as that.
