## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello,

I am new member at this emailing list.

Have 3 rv parks that need a simple wifi hotspot management system.

Some rv parks have more than one broadband connection and in different 
locations.

Have prior experience with zone public ip cd server, but project no 
longer in existence.

Your Grase hotspot system would be able to handle something like this?

Also looking at Easyhotspot but I think portal chillispot project is no 
longer around or now is called coovachilli.

Any help appreciated.
