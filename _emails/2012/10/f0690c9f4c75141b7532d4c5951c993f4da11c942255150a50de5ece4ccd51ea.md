## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hey everyone.

Good news. I've spent the whole day working on the freeradius bug to do
with the sqlcounter limited at 4Gb. To avoid re-inventing the wheel I've
taken a few modules from the Yfi Hotcakes hotspot, which are under the
perlartistic license. (I was going to write my own, but why when I could
end up with a square wheel instead of a round one!)

It has needed some customisations, and I've made some improvements to in,
in particular I still had to make changes to it to support >4Gb tickets.
Basically I put in Gigaword support, which is what Coova Chilli and
Freeradius use to get around the 32bit issue of RADIUS messages.

Its unreleased at the moment, however it doesn't depend on any changes in
other packages, so I could release it shortly once I test it enough. If
there are brave people around who have the 4Gb problem, and are willing to
test it, please let me know as it would be much appreciated. (If it does
break, you'll be able to downgrade it to the previous version)

I look forward to testers so we can get this much needed fix out there!

Tim
