## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Great idea Thomas.

This is something that we should be able to implement in Freeradius. 
I'll have to do some research into how it handles something called a 
"default group", but we should be able to put an Auth Reject in the 
default group settings, and a message why. However that would only 
reject at login. On top of that we'd need a template file to display 
instead of the login page.

If you could file a bug for me Thomas, I'll try and get onto it soon. 
For now, you can probably just put a hotspot.html file in the uam 
directory, so that requests for /grase/uam/hotspot could be possibly 
served by hotspot.html (off the top of my head, can't think if it'll 
work without moving the hotspot.php file away).
