{% raw  %}#86: Allow Admin  to  archive a user's session data,  which will reset their
"data usage"
-----------------------------+-----------------
 Reporter:  bob hunt         |      Owner:  tim
     Type:  enhancement      |     Status:  new
 Priority:  minor            |  Milestone:  3.9
Component:  Admin Interface  |    Version:  3.7
 Keywords:                   |
-----------------------------+-----------------
 Add a button to Admin's "edituser" page to archive a user's session data
 in order to reset their "data usage" back to zero.

 This is needed as there is currently a bug in freeradius which prevents a
 user being allocated a data limit greater than 4 Gb, so it is difficult to
 allow regular monthly users to keep their usernames.

 4 modified files attached

 In /usr/share/grase/www/radmin/templates/edituser.tpl add a
 'resetDataUseSubmit' button at lines 87 to 93.

 In /usr/share/grase/www/radmin/edituser.php insert a new function;
 "if(isset($_POST['resetDataUseSubmit']))" function at lines 163 to 172
 (calls "database_archive_user_data($username)"

 In /usr/share/grase/www/radmin/includes/database_functions.inc.php insert
 a new function;
 "function database_archive_user_data($username)" at lines 264 to 267
 (calls "condenseThisUser($username)")

 In /usr/share/grase/www/radmin/classes/DatabaseFunctions.class.php insert
 a new function;
  "public function condenseThisUser($username)" at lines 1392 to 1507

 The DatabaseFunction added is based on condensePreviousMonthsAccounting()
 in cronFunctions.class.php. It condenses and moves all the current user's
 session data (except any open sessions), from radacct into mtotacct but
 doesn't touch radcheck.
