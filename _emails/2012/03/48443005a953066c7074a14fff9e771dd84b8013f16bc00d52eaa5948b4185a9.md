Hi

I' m working on the project. Next week I will receive a Cisco\Linksys WRT54GL to test coovaAP. 

For a generic wifi router I will put the "internet" interface in dhcp connected to the donators lan (or configurated to use and if there is a coovabox I will connect on the lan interface.


 In the meaning time I'm testing the solution on a ubuntu linux box (BOX1) where I can test everything connected trough openvpn to the SERVER (the machine that running grase hotspot), cause some setup can use a linux box (so I can use any access points with their own firmware)


I have correctly setup the openvpn, trough I can reach from BOX1 the SERVER and I surf trough BOX1 wifi private (not shared) connection.

To simplify I will assume 10.0.1.x/24 is the grase wifi net (gived by BOX1 wifi connected to eth0) and 192.168.1.100 (eth1) is the ip BOX1 (gw 192.168.1.1) SERVER has ip 10.1.0.1 reached trogh tun1

eth0 of BOX1 is connected wifi router (SID PUBLIC) is 10.0.1.101 and SERVER is 10.1.0.1

I have installed only coova chilli on the BOX1 and I' m configuring it to use SERVER for everything is needed (except dhcp)

I guess have some problem with dhcp and maybe I don't know coova too much. It will give dhcp to client ? 

For the security point i will use something like

iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -i eth0 -o eth1 -d !192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -i eth0 -o eth1 -j DROP
iptables -i eth1 -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT


I will continue testing but for the beginning I could setup manually each box/router cause at the moment I have only 10 "testers" and two have a linux box.

Thanks in advance

(I guess I could launch a sf project if I receive feedback from some LUG here)
