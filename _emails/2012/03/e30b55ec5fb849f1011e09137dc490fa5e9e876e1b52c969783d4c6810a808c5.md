I've never used testing like this before, but it is a very good idea.
Now I look at ticket 42, I wonder how it's gone so long without being
fixed! If you could resend the code you had sent me, that would be
good. I'm sure I have it somewhere, but with most of my stuff on my
dead computer, it would be easier if you sent it again. That way I can
look at PHPUnit2 and ticket 42 all at once.

I know that the fix I did last year, was to fix an issue, and it did
fix the issue at the time. However, it obviously wasn't tested enough
as it didn't fix the issue properly as the CAST was around the whole
equation instead of just the string variable.
