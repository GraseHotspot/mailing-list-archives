## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi All.

I regret to announce that there will be a delay on development, due to
my computer dieing recently. Until I can replace the computer I will
not be able to do any development.
All packages are hosted on a dedicated VPS so you will be able to
continue making new installs, there just won't be any updates until we
can afford to replace the computer. This is disappointing for me as
I'm 1/2 way through the paypal integration.

Thanks for your patience.

Tim White
