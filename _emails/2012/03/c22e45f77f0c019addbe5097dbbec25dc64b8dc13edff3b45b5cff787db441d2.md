{% raw  %}#67: Simultaneous logon problems
----------------------------------------------+-----------------
 Reporter:  frank arne hammer√∏                |      Owner:  tim
     Type:  defect                            |     Status:  new
 Priority:  major                             |  Milestone:
Component:  Other Backend                     |    Version:  3.7
 Keywords:  Logon, simultaneous, NAT, router  |
----------------------------------------------+-----------------
 I just tried to make 30 people log onto Grase hotspot at the same time
 through a wifi router with NAT.
 The router has WAN IP 10.1.0.3 and the LAN-side 192.168.1.1. It therefore
 leases IPs to clients that logs on to the network.
 The first user logs on just fine, gets blasting speed when surfing, but
 everyone else gets the "Please wait"-sign where the username and password
 is supposed to be filled inn. After a couple of minutes, a few more people
 gets logged on, but the post-logon screen shows that they are logged in as
 the first user.
 I know these problems disappear when I disable NAT, and use the router as
 an access point without DHCP, so I guess this has something to do with the
 way users are handled by Grase. Anyway, this could be a problem for those
 who don't turn off NAT in their access points/routers.
