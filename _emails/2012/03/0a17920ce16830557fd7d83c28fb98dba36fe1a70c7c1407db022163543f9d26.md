There isn't a way to do this yet, but wouldn't be hard to do. I'm just
wondering what your use case for it is? Ideally, if an account has
expired, its ready to be "cleaned" up (archived), and if the user is
still active, they'll be "purchasing" more time/data and not need to
be archived. If you are needing a cron job to unexpire an account,
might it be better to have no expiry?
