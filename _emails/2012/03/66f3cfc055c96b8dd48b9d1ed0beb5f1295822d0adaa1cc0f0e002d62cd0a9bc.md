## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi.

I'm currently out, so a quick response. We've changed from showing limits
and usage to showing remaining quota. This may be more confussing if you
are used to the previous way of displaying the information and I'm looking
at better was of displaying the information. Suggestions are welcome.

I realise that change wasn't supposed to be in the package until it was
tested more, the main purpose of that release was some big bugs in reports,
and translations. I'll check it when I can and respond properly then.

Thanks for your patience. Sorry to hear that the 3.7 update went badly for
you, do you know what broke so badly?

Tim
