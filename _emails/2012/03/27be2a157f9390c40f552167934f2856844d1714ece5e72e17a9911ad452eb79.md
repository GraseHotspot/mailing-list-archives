Comment (by hans van de voorde):

 I think that the principle should be still the same. The fixed parts
 should be translated as normal. The Hotspot owner dependent data should be
 stored per language version and would be still the responsability of the
 Hotsopt owner. (in my company we were maintaining 12 language versions of
 our software. There was just one version and all the text's of forms and
 reports were storred in a oracle database. the user could in the login
 form choose his language from a dropdown box (from the list of available
 languages cq licenced/installed langage databases. Customer customized
 froms/reports could be storred in the same language database)(This was a
 clear and easy way to do it . Easy for the translators and for
 maintenance, and easy for us to charge per language)
