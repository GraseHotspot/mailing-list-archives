This sounds like a 32bit overflow, although those numbers are so large
they are too big to even be an overflow. Are you using a 64bit machine
or a 32bit machine?
"Expired" users are deleted after a month from expiry. But I take it
you are also talking about accounts that have been used to completion,
before the expiry date.
I'd be interested in working out what's gone wrong. Can you send me
your backups (/var/backups/grase/, find the radius table backups, not
the radmin ones). If you could let me know which users have the issue,
and send me say a backup a week from the last 2-3 months? (Or if they
are small enough, zip/tar them all up and send me them all). Then I
can step through each backup and work out when something went wrong,
and try and work out if its the archival code or something else odd.

I'm guessing it may be getting overwritten. I'll look more into this
once I get a new computer, because we need coaport to work for the
ticket #28.
