## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Raphael.

Coova shouldn't be trying to configure all NICs. It sounds like you need 
to login to the admin interface and find under Network Settings the WAN 
and LAN nics. Check they are what you expect and then save the settings 
to make sure it's saved. (WAN is automatic, LAN can you select. WAN is 
based on the gateway route). It sounds like Coova is trying to use the 
NIC that you wish to use for the internal network, so you just need to 
change it's LAN nic to the correct one and it should work.
If after doing that it's still trying to configure it, we'll need to do 
some debugging to find out what's happening. (Make sure you leave 
Coova's NIC totally unconfigured, no ip address, no firewall etc.)
