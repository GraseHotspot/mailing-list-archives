{% raw  %}Spot on tim... That did the trick...

Just to summarise:

Host ws is win xp
Ubuntu vm on host (eth0 = nat eth1 = briged)

Xp client vm on host (eth0 = briged)

Login to xp client launch google and asked for the login!

Due to routing, it won't be able to test the hotspot from the host machine, as it's default gateway is obviously not the hotspot, and the network interface it has to the LAN needs to be under the control of the hotspot, so it can't also use that same network interface to talk to the hotspot.

(Unless someone who is running it differently successfully can correct me). The WAN interface on the guest needs to be a virtual one that uses the host as the gateway. The LAN interface on the guest needs to be the hosts LAN interface, at layer 2 (no ip routing to make it happen), referred to as bridged in virtualbox.

One for the hotspot server (WAN interface is "natted" in virtualbox, and LAN interface is internal only) and the "testing" machine which has one network interface that is on the internal only network as well. This way your host machine isn't also trying to be your test machine, the test environment is confined to that one physical machine and it generally just works. Layer 2 routing between the host network and the guest network can just be so picky that I gave up in my test environment and just boot up multiple virtual machines. (Which helps as I don't normally have windows machines on     my home network).
