Comment:

 See http://trac.grasehotspot.org/wiki/FAQ_T0_F2
 The problem is due to the NAT. The wireless access point MUST not be a
 router (or if it is, it needs to act as just an access point).
 NAT "hides" all the users behind a single device, behind a single ip
 address (normally) and a single mac address. It has no way of knowing that
 each user is different as the users are effectively in their own private
 network.
 The Grase Hotspot needs to be in total control of the private network that
 it is in, and it's users need to be in the same network.

 Unfortunately there is no way to handle devices behind NAT. (We can handle
 devices that are in a different network that are routed via a router
 without NAT, however this is very complicated and so not setup)
