It is possible, but not supported currently. The reason being is you 
then need to MySQL database there too, and it starts to get a bit more 
complicated. If you are doing this, you need to modify the files in 
/etc/grase/ to point to the database on the other server so that the 
admin interface and the user interfaces can access it, as they access it 
directly and not through radius.
What's you reason for wanting to do it like this?

Grase already does this (the javascript based login does chap challenge 
response). It falls back to a less secure method if javascript is 
disabled, that still does CHAP but uses PHP scripts to do the challenge 
and response. So what I could do, is add an option so it doesn't 
fallback to the less secure method ever, but then users without 
javascript won't be able to login. Currently the non-javascript login 
warns the user about it being less secure.

No problem. Hope that answers your questions.
