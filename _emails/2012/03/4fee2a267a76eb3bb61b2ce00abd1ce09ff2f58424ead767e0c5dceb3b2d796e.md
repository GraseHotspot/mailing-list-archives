## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I have been having a lot of trouble lately with users greatly exceeding 
their bandwidth allowance.
My desired solution would be to log out such accounts on a per-minute basis.

I have followed the steps listed on Ticket 28: Ability to disconnect 
active users (http://trac.grasehotspot.org/ticket/28), but the command 
fails.
 From the command-line I get the following:

$ sudo /bin/echo "User-Name=/blah123/" | /usr/bin/radclient -x 
127.0.0.1:3779 disconnect /radsecret/
Sending Disconnect-Request of id 212 to 127.0.0.1 port 3779
     User-Name = "/blah123/"
Sending Disconnect-Request of id 212 to 127.0.0.1 port 3779
     User-Name = "/blah123/"
Sending Disconnect-Request of id 212 to 127.0.0.1 port 3779
     User-Name = "/blah123/"
radclient: no response from server for ID 212 socket 3

Googling the issue suggested I add udp port 3779 to my iptables, but 
that still didn't work.

Has anyone else had success with this?
I would appreciate the assist...
