## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Well, as you can see Tim. All the recorded data on user accounts is
corrupted. Most users with 1000minute tickets are now showing as 499
or 955 minutesÂ allocated. And those with expired tickets now have
hours of time remaining. Its all a bit of a mess.
Problem is that we have around 1000 accounts on the system as we are
running grase in large resort. The staff at the reception have been
issuing refunds all morning.
I have a backup from yesterday prior to the update. I am thinking of
restoring, however i do not want grase to self update. How can i stop
it?

Regards
