## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Grase updated to 3.7.3 this morning and noticed some problems with
"Time-Usage, Remaining-Time, Data-Usage" fields.
I have attached a picture of the bug. Pretty much 80% off all accounts
have the problem.

This is not the first time an update has broken the system. 3.7 was a
disaster, i ended up re installing from scratch.
How does grase currently self update? Is it a cron-job which runs
apt-get update? I cannot seem to find any grase repo's
in /etc/apt/_sources_._list so im assuming its located _ELSEWHERE_?_
_Again, Tim. Thank you for the reply to my previous questions. You
were very _HELPFUL_, i have just not had the time to reply. I will
keep you update._
