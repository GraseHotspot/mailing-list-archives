Ticket 56 (http://trac.grasehotspot.org/ticket/56) is for the 
"decentralisation" of the Hotspot.
Ideally we can make this happen with minimal changes, by allowing 
packages like the dnsmasq config package, and the chilli package to be 
installed without depending on everything else. We then need to have a 
meta package that will install all the server components, and a meta 
package that will install all the client components. Maybe a meta 
package that installs both lots so setups like we currently do use the 
"overall" meta package.
The trick is then to make sure that at install of the client packages, 
if we don't have the server packages will somehow get the required 
details to contact the server. For simplicity, I think we need the web 
server to stay on the server, so the client doesn't need any MySQL 
components. (Ideally this will also allow us to use the embedded router 
firmwares)
