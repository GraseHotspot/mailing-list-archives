## Raw message

{% raw  %}Thanx tim for the info... And quick reply...

I need to sort out my first issue (sent to you as vmware installation) currently being held by moderator as its too big.

Basically i am a windows user(sry)...
Running ubuntu in vm workstation 7.

I get connection reset error when browsing 10.1.0.1:3990 from ubuntu vm and also from windows host. At this point im not using any ap. just vm network and windows xp as its dhcp (win is connected to internet via wireless)

Thanx tim

This /is/ possible with Coova Chilli, which the Grase Hotspot uses, but as I've not had hardware able to do this, I have no instructions for doing it. It's also not the easiest way for end users as not all devices support it (or support it well).

So having the router on the 172.x.x.x range is fine, and you should set the Hotspots WAN interface to be in the same range (or use DHCP).

> Open is preferred. Depending on your use case. i.e. If you are a cafe and want to sell internet to your customers, then having an open network means they can discover the network easily, connect, then when they try to use it, they are redirected to the login page which will have purchasing instructions. If you have a closed network, then most customers won't even realise that you sell WiFi access. (Lots of smartphones notify you if there is an open network nearby).
> It's also a good idea in the help section to inform users that due to it being an open network, it's security can't be guaranteed and to make sure they are using https versions of websites etc etc.

> Ideally, the kind of Wireless Access Point you want to use, are those that are 'Layer 2', i.e. don't do any routing, don't do DHCP (or can turn DHCP off). See the FAQ (http://trac.grasehotspot.org/wiki/FAQ) for more info.
