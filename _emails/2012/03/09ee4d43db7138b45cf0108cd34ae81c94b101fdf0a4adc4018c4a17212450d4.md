That would also work. I would however not put it among the general install instructions, as some users might think that it is essential for the hotspot to work. I do think it belongs in the install instructions page, but under it's own section, perhaps at the bottom of the page, to emphasize that it's optional.


May I also suggest a further idea, that might simplify the install instructions.
You could create a dummy/meta package that will install the other needed packages. In this package, there is not a single file to be installed. The package will simply have the other grase packages as dependencies. This will have the effect that installing this One package will result in the other grase packages and their dependencies beeing installed.
Let's say the package is called "grase-install". Then the user only have to run "apt-get install grase-install" (after installing grase-repo and updating the package list), and all grase packages will be installed. (The stats package should not be a dependency in this meta package.)

Debian does this. The "build-essentials" package (among others) is such a meta package, which have development packages and tools as dependencies.
