I do think it belongs in the install instructions page, but under it's own section, perhaps at the bottom of the page, to emphasize that it's optional.

I'm sure I'll make it obvious that it's not required.

This isn't hard to do, and I'm planning on something like this in the
future that also allows a new feature. Basically, there is a "need"
for some people to install a hotspot "server" and then have "clients"
that run off that server (multiple access points for example). I plan
on accommodating this with meta packages and having 3 meta packages.
grase-install-standalone would be what most people would use, and
grase-install-server and grase-install-client would be the separated
ones for people having separate server to client packages. (And the
server and client packages would probably be dependencies for the
standalone package to make it even cleaner).

It's annoying that you can't just download the grase-repo package and
that installs everything, I'm trying to find a way to make an
"installer" that when installed will add the repo, and install all the
required packages from the repo. The main issue is that a debian
package, can't then call another apt-get install while its installing,
so it would probably have to be a shell script that installs
grase-repo, then installs the rest. These are all improvements over
the current system, but hopefully when they are done it'll make life
much easier.

I recently changed the grase-conf-openvpn packages to a new system
that makes life great. Install the package, and during the install it
gets the key signing request signed via the remote server without
having to wait for me to manually do it. It also handles re-installs
better where the hostname hasn't changed, but of course the client key
has. I'll be releasing the server code for that shortly, as I'm sure
it'll be beneficial for anyone trying to automatically setup VPN keys.
