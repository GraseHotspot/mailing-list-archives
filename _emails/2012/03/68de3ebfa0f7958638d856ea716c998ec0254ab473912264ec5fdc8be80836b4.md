Hi I'm working on the centralization of grase for another project, at the moment the documentation is only italian, but if you want to cooperate I can translate docs.

Search for "integrate grase on router" in the mailing list.

I have very little time to work on it, so far the auth with radtest work perfectly with centralized mysql server but there must be a vpn between client and server.

I hope to hear from you soon.
