Comment (by tim):

 It's probably not possible to get a list of users on each access point, as
 from a networking point of view, Coova Chilli doesn't know which access
 point a user is on (and seeing as the access points should be basically
 transparent from a Layer 3 point of view, it has no way of knowing which
 access point a user is on).

 All active users can be seen in the "Monitor Sessions" page. I'm intending
 to modify it to show more clearly which users are still logged in
 (probably just have a table above the current one that just shows active
 sessions, and the current one to just show finished sessions). The IP
 address are already in that table, and if you hover over the ip address
 (or click it) it'll show you the MAC address.

 Is that what you are looking for?
