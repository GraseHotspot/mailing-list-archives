## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}The problem has been found!
Seems a fix from earlier actually broke it! (Fix was last year, so not
sure how it wasn't noticed until now!)

As I can't access my dev environment, for now here is a patch you can
apply. I also strongly recommend everyone runs the following SQL after
applying the patch to fix any users who are "broken"

UPDATE radcheck SET radcheck.value = 0 WHERE radcheck.Attribute =
'Max-Octets' AND CAST(radcheck.value AS SIGNED INTEGER) < 0

If you don't want to apply the patch, just run this sql nightly and
it'll ensure things are fixed until I can get a new release out.

It's important that everyone realise that if you dont' apply this fix
or run this sql nightly (until I get a release out), any user who has
used up all their quota, will be able to use basically unlimited quota
when they are archived in 2 months time.
Thanks iii for providing data to help find the problem
