## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}For anyone who is brave, here is a package you can install with the
fixes, plus a few other fixes that were waiting to be released.

http://dev.packages.grasehotspot.org/pool/main/g/grase-www-portal/grase-www-portal_3.7.4-dev2_all.deb

Please be clear, this is a dev package, because I'm unable to properly
test it atm due my lack of decent computer and dev environment. It
took long enough without my normal computer and environment to fix
this bug, and even longer just to sign this package with my gpg key!
Please consider testing this package, as the bug fixes are very
important for anyone who uses data limits (time limits not so
important). If you do use this package, keep an eye on the list for
any updates or issues, and if you have any issues with it, report back
to the list please.

I will skip version 3.7.4 when I am up and running again, and what
ever the latest 3.7.4-dev package is, that I can then test, it will
become 3.7.5.

Thanks

Tim
p.s. You may add the dev repository to your apt sources, however, at
times it may be broken as it is the dev repository that I push to, to
test, before I push to the one everyone uses
