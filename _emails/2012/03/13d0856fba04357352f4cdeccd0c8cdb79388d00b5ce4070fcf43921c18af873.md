{% raw  %}Hi to all

I' m working on the centralization of grase for and Italian project. I' m following Tim's advice (read below), if you want to cooperate I can translate in english and link what I have done.

I guess that Tim has to approve this anyway, if someone is interested write me a mail, (or write to gomitolo at adfacom dot it)

thanks a lot

Antonio Alessio "dikdust" Di Pinto
