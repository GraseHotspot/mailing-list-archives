{% raw  %}#65: Need new system to handle database and upgrades
---------------------------------+-----------------
 Reporter:  tim                  |      Owner:  tim
     Type:  enhancement          |     Status:  new
 Priority:  major                |  Milestone:  4.0
Component:  Other Backend        |    Version:  3.6
 Keywords:  packaging, database  |
---------------------------------+-----------------
 Currently we use db-common to handle databases. This doesn't port well to
 other distros, and isn't that pleasant to use. We also use the CRON
 functions to do minor upgrades and other things like that.

 Proposal:
 Use a "sql" manager to have pure sql patches for all database changes.
 Split this into it's own package that all other packages can depend on.
 This package will handle the radius and radmin databases, for all schema
 related things, and any pure sql related updates.
 (Split out of freeradius the database settings into another file as well,
 so updates to sql.conf.grase can take place)
 This package also needs to handle generating a random password for radius
 and radmin databases, and ensuring that they can actually login. Maybe we
 can try using the built in Debian "maintenance" mysql password to do our
 "root" work, and fallback to prompting the user? (Prompting requires
 debconf).
 CRON functions will only do non schema related changes, and can ensure
 that the database schema version is greater than the required one, as well
 as having an internal "patch" applied kind of table for ensuring both sql
 and cron "patches" are marked off as done when applied.
