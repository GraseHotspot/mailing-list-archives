Comment:

 This has always been the intention. It has become more difficult now that
 we allow total customisation of the login interface.

 Original plan (when you couldn't customise the login) was to translate it
 like the rest of the interface. Now that you can customise it, we need a
 way to indicate what text can be translated (probably same was we
 currently do it in templates, with {t} {/t} tags), then we need a way for
 the hotspot owner to translate the text. I'm thinking that normal Gettext
 tools aren't going to cut it for the average hotspot owner.

 Any ideas on how we do this (from a GUI point of view)?

 The text that doesn't change should be easier to translate, which means
 the usermin section is easy to do.
