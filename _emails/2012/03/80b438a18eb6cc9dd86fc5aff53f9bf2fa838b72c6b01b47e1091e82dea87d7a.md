I believe you have been issuing refunds unnecessarily. Nothing has 
changed in the backend with the last update, the only thing that has 
changed is the display of user limits changing into the display of 
remaining time.
All the tickets in the picture you are display appear to be for a time 
limit of 100 minutes, (or 1hr 40) and so all the red ones are users who 
have used the entire 100 minutes. 00:00:00 shows that there is no time 
remaining. The numbers in brackets (for time usage) show the total time 
usage while the numbers outside the brackets show the time usage for the 
last ~month.
The reason for the change is that Limits are "adjusted" after about 2 
months, as the session data is archived. So e.g, you have a user with a 
60 min time limit, and last month they used 20 mins, the 20 mins worth 
of sessions are archived, and the limit is adjusted to be 40 mins. This 
can look confussing when the users limits change each month until they 
have used up their whole limit. It makes more sense to show how much 
time is remaining for the user, and how much time has been used (and 
adding the 2 up will give you their initial limit).

Again, I'll emphasise, the update did not change any stored users, or 
any of that part of the backend, only thing that changed was how it's 
displayed.

Auto updates are covered in the FAQ http://trac.grasehotspot.org/wiki/FAQ

Hope that helps. Sorry that it confused you. That particular part of the 
update wasn't supposed to be made live yet, just some new features to do 
with Time Limits and some backend changes in the freeradius package 
(which doesn't effect the users or their settings) to allow monitoring 
of failed login attempts.
