Hi Andre.
You need to check that the server has no problems with the internet.
First, login to the server (ether via ssh or locally).
Try to ping an external server (i.e. 'ping 8.8.8.8' will try to ping a 
google dns server)
If that works, then check if local DNS forwarder is working. 'dig 
@127.0.0.1 google.com' should return an ip address for google.com.

If that is working, check in the admin interface, under network 
settings, that the LAN interface is eth1, and the WAN interface is eth0.

When you try to goto a website, do you get directed to the login page? 
If so, chances are the internet is working, and so is the hotspot. If 
after logging in it doesn't work, what error message do you get? A 
timeout page? You'll need to check if squid is working. Also, have you 
installed a firewall of your own, if so, please uninstall it and allow 
the hotspot firewall to do it's thing.

Tim
