Sorry, I blurred the distinction between you and the IT administrators.

I've heard it too, too many times.

And if you don't need the logs for this purpose, you are not allowed to store them at all.

Even if you explicitly state you are monitoring? Wow. I would have 
thought that in a school situation for example, where you state you are 
explicitly monitoring, it wouldn't be a problem. For example, if kids 
are using the internet for purposes other than they are allowed (i.e. 
playing games on the net), then their internet privileges can be 
revoked, and hence monitoring is needed to enforce the policy.

Just the squid logs? Just edit /etc/logrotate.d/squid3.grase changing 
the "rotate 8" line to the number of weeks you wish to keep. The hotspot 
doesn't actually use the squid logs for accounting (just for seeing what 
was done in a session), so you can safely disable squid logging if you 
need to.
The radius DB logs need to be kept until they are "archived" at the end 
of the month. Given that there is no identifying information in those 
logs, just traffic and time counters, I'd assume you don't need to worry 
about them regarding privacy.

No problem. These are actually good questions that need to end up in the 
FAQ on trac.grasehotspot.org when I get around to it.
