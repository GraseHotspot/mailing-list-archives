## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}As you may have noticed in bug #60, recurring limits don't work for the 
first login of the time period.
It appears an upstream change may have broken this, not really sure, but 
the fix is simple and commited.
Please update your grase-conf-freeradius package if you are using 
recurring limits, otherwise you risk a crafty user using way past their 
limit!

Thanks

Tim
