Hi Johnbert.

Can you please confirm the versions of some of your packages? There was 
a few small updates pushed out recently, one was to fix a security 
issue, and one was to hopefully fix the very issue you are describing.

Run 'apt-cache policy grase-conf-squid3 grase-conf-dnsmasq' and confirm 
that the output looks like the following.

grase-conf-squid3:
   Installed: 1.2
   Candidate: 1.2
   Version table:
  *** 1.2 0
         500 http://packages.grasehotspot.org/ purewhite/main amd64 Packages
         100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
grase-conf-dnsmasq:
   Installed: 1.6
   Candidate: 1.6
   Version table:
  *** 1.6 0
         500 http://packages.grasehotspot.org/ purewhite/main amd64 Packages
         100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

If not, please do a "sudo apt-get update" "sudo apt-get upgrade" and 
check that the grase packages are all the latest version.

If they are and you are still having the problem, can you see what is 
shown in the squid access and cache logs.

Thanks

Tim
