## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}My test setup is in place in the pub now, which means I have little access to the hardware, unless I am able to get there when there is someone in the office.

Mostly I have it set up with computer accounts for locals with smartphones, and tickets behind the bar for others that come in with laptops etc.  There are only about 20 computer accounts and only a few tickets have been issued / used.

After a couple  of weeks I found that the hotspot was no longer working - devices would only get an autoassign  (169.254.x.x) address. My feeling was that the host laptop had been shutdown or the secondary network cable pulled, but when I finally got there last Friday I found it all working fine and it had upgraded itself to 3.7 :) But sometime on Saturday evening (may have been a bit busy because of the rugby), it was once again not assigning addresses to clients.

The setup is pretty much out of the box ( I did have a custom logo on the portal pages, but that seems to have been overwritten in the upgrade to 3.7) so as I understand it is only handing out 10 minute dhcp leases and there is no way they could all be used up unless released ones are not being properly released. And even then usually a renewal would result in the same address being reused. So I can't see why it stops issuing addresses.

As I said, I have limited access to the system now, but I can talk someone through a shutdown / reboot of the system, but am more keen to know what is going on with it.
