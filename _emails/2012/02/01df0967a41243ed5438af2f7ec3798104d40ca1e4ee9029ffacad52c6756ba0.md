## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Let me start of by saying that I'm not complaning. 
I have a habit of thinking out loud, and sometimes people think that I critizise them or is angry, when I'm not.

In case I haven't been clear, I actually think this system is excellent and is just what the world need: A Free Software project targeted at enviroments who need network acountabilliy and security, which is easy to setup, configure and use, targeted at those who whould never use a proprietary solution.

So I'm asking these questions with the hope of making the project better. If the documentation get more clear or better because of my questions, then I have accoplished what I want: Making it better. A good software project have good documentation. :-)=

This is one of the things I think is a good thing to write something about, on your site.
Something about what promted you to make this, the motivations for it. Somehow that tells some users if this is something they are looking for.

This is something you also should say something about in a guide or installation instructions.
Some users will have an exitsting network setup and already do have a server which they are thinking of install this on like in my friend's case. Therefore it should say something about which components that are required for the system to work, and why they should use dnsmasq and why they need Your squid server build rather than the distro provided server, for example.

No worries. :-)=
Like I said above, I'm thinking out loud, hoping to understand why you do things the way you do.

Understanding why something works the way it does is often what is needed to understand why one shouldn't change how it works. and your replies have been more enlightening to me, than the documentation I have been reading.

Keep up the good work. :-)=
