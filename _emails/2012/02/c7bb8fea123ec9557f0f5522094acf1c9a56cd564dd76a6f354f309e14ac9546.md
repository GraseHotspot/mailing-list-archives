Unfortunately, if you give a computer any internet access, then a worm 
can do what it likes. I'd expect most ISP's to know this, and 
essentially what they are asking you is to block the users who's 
computers are infected, not an easy task. This is one of those issues 
faced by anyone who is running an ISP, and yes, if you are running a 
hotspot, you are an ISP. Bigger ISPs use lots of packet matching rules 
to identify malware and can then trace it back to the user who is 
sending it. For a smaller ISP, it's much harder. So unless Endian 
firewall can do some of that matching and blocking, its not going to help.

Probably the only way to totally block it, is to only give port 80 web 
access. So no HTTPS (SSL) web access on port 443, which rules out things 
like internet banking, secure gmail/facebook/twitter which is becoming 
the default now days. That way, all access is logged in Squid, which 
will help identify worms.

I'd be asking the ISP for all information they can provide about the 
worm, and be locking down the firewall with some of the rules I gave. 
(I'd allow HTTPS and secure IMAP and POP3). Then if the worm is still 
tunneling out, hopefully you'll see it in squid logs. I'd also run some 
things like netstat on the hotspot (and a few other tools I can't think 
of off the top of my head) which will show all connections being made 
through the Hotspot. Filter out the common domains (google, facebook, 
akami cdn, twitter, etc etc) and then compile a list of everything else 
being connected to (and where it's being connected from). You should 
hopefully be able to shrink the list down until you only see suspicious 
looking behaviour at which point you should also be able to see what 
computer (and user) it's coming from.

Depending on your country, the ISP really needs to be working with you 
to block it, not just threating to shut you down (as most "end users" 
won't be able to easily find the source of malware). Ideally you need 
from the the ports, destinations, times etc of attacks, and packet 
signatures that identify it.
