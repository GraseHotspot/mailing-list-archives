## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

I have just received a notification of network abuse from my ISP, due to a worm sending spam from somewhere in my network.
As all my systems are running Linux, I assume that one of my customers, running unprotected Windoze, is responsible.
I have a vanilla installation of Grase.
What can I install/tweak on the Grase hotspot server to prevent any such incident from occurring again?


I urgently require a response as I have very few days to resolve the issue.

Thanks,
Tim
{% endraw %}
