{% raw  %}Hi 

I'm a volunteer in and NGO here in Turin in Italy and I'm also the sysadmin of my IT company. I would like to share my internet link with my neighboorhod (as NGO) and I succefully do it with grase. 

Now the next step is to extend this free wifi hotspot with others in my zone that want to share their internet connection and this using credentials in my grase server (which I can configure in any way and I have public ip).

I have read of http://www.dd-wrt.com but I don't know if is possible to use it with grase and I also want to limit bandwith of those who give for free their internet connections and limit it to one hour by day, for the users that use this connections.

I will give the router for free (I will buy it and donate as company) and this object must obviously act as router, I mean one interface must get the internet connection trough the lan of the "sharer" but obviously the ip of the user who connecting is one of my grase lan (the lan of the sharer must be secure).

Is possible ? I don't want to spend not more than 100â‚¬ for client (I have done it something with koala but is too expensive and need to much hardware - too complicate for the sharer..)

Thanks a lot

Antonio Alessio "dikdust" Di Pinto
