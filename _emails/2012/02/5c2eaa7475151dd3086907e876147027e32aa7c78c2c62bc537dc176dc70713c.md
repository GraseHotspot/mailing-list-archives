This is true.
There are 2 reasons for this currently. The first is that it's a little 
harder to translate the text in the reports graphs, due to it being an 
external javascript library. However I do have a technique for this, and 
will implement it.

The second reason, is due to the note at the top of the reports page. I 
need feedback about the reports page, what works, what doesn't, what 
people want to see on it, etc etc. For example, if graphed reports 
aren't what people want, and instead they want summary tables, then I 
need to know that. If the type of graphs or how the data is graphed 
isn't useful, I need to know that.
So please people, give me some feedback as to how you want the reports 
page to look like! (Mockups are great too). The only thing I'd say, 
please avoid Flash based things (graphs etc) and go for more javascript 
or static things. (Of course, any libraries you want to use need to be 
able to be used in a GPLed project, so preferably GPL libraries)

I've opened a bug regarding the translations, so it should be done in 
the next few weeks.
