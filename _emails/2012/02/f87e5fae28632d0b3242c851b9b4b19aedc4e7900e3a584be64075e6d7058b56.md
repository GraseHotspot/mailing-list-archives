{% raw  %}Hi Tim,
As you know I've installed your grase hotspot in my Debian 6.04.
I tried to install it in others Ubuntu version and I couldn't do it, but I 
think that the problem was with dnsmasq.
We was talking about it here 
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=621E5297535A4BA8B66D7BE8DB2686E9%40PC&forum_name=grase-hotspot
I remember that you fix something of it but I didn't try to install in 
Ubuntu again.
Now I'm very happy with your system. It works great!
Tomorrow I'm going to configure the Radius server in about 20 cisco access 
point and then I'm going to put my server in production. I think that I'll 
have about 400 people and I hope that everything go well. (I'll keep my 
fingers crossed)
I've configured in NETWORK SETTINGS -->  Lan Network mask as 255.255.252.0 
and I hope that all of my users can get an IP address.
Anyway thanks Tim again for your job.

Thanks
Oscar

Hey Everyone.

Just trying to get some feedback from everyone. Firstly, I've confirmed
today that it will not run on Ubuntu 10.04, and will not support
attempts to make it run on something that old (even though it is LTS).
The first problem is Squid3, as we use features that aren't in 3.0, but
are in 3.1. Then there are problems with php5 as well.

I can confirm that I run it very well on Debian 6.0, and will support
that. It should also run on 10.10, although I haven't yet checked that.

So, please let me know what distro versions you are running it on, and
if you had issues getting it running (satisfying dependencies.)

I know some people would prefer that it run on LTS, but unfortunately
for 10.04 it won't. I also know some people would like it to run on a
non debian based distribution, but again, that's not going to happen
unless someone rewrites all the packages, or installs dpkg/apt-get on it!

Tim
