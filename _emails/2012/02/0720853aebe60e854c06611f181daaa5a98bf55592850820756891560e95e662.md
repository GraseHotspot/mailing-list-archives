There are some firewall rules built into the Hotspot, so if someone 
tries to use another DNS server, it transparently forces them to use the 
local one. So no settings need to be changed on your router.
Regarding using the OpenDNS Family filter. I was unable to get an answer 
from the last time I contacted them, so have been including it as the 
default DNS pending a response from them. I'll try and track it down 
again. You are probably best off looking into their "paid" services, 
which I'm sure includes discounts for schools. (On their main page, they 
boast that 1 in 3 schools in the US use them, so who knows, maybe they 
provide it free?)
I've opened a ticket to again try tracking down an answer about OpenDNS 
being included by default, and who can use it.

Tim
