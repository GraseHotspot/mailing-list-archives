## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}#61: When clock goes backwards, things break
---------------------------+-----------------
 Reporter:  tim            |      Owner:  tim
     Type:  defect         |     Status:  new
 Priority:  minor          |  Milestone:  3.8
Component:  Other Backend  |    Version:  3.6
 Keywords:                 |
---------------------------+-----------------
 A bit of a corner case, but will cause problems on some devices.
 If the clock goes backwards (i.e. no battery for CMOS clock) and things
 like ntp don't work properly (maybe internet is down when it boots up)
 then we end up with sessions that are just plain wrong due to them being
 as far back as 12 years (Jan 2000).
 We need to detect if time has gone backwards by more than say 2 hours
 (plenty of leeway for daylight savings), prehaps by testing if now() is
 more than 2 hours before the last successful login to the hotspot. If so,
 we deny logins and ask the administrator to set the time manually? So in
 Radius we reject logins with error "time has gone backwards" maybe with a
 link to the admin area, were we again detect time having gone backwards
 and ask the administrator to set the time correctly, with the option to
 override it (i.e. by placing a special login session?)

 Not sure how to make all this happen, as CoovaChilli will also get the
 reject message, as it authenticates for settings.
