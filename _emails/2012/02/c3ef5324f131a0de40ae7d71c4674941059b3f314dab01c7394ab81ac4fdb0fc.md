No, the schools /IT administrator/ misunderstand, while Frank on the other hand, which is a friend of mine, understand and prefer it, especially on servers.

Many people really do believe that Free and open source software is more prone to security issiues because "the hackers" can read teh code and find security holes.
Obviously they can't find security holes in closed source propriety software, you understand. :-)= ... I have actually heard this argument being made. Hehe.

Unless you happens to live in Norway, in which case you are not allowed to store such logs for any other purpose than to calculate payments for the service or for system stability and security purposes. normaly no longer that 3 weeks. And if you don't need the logs for this purpose, you are not allowed to store them at all.

We have strong privacy laws in this country. :-)=

Is it possible to configure the backup routine to delete logs older that X weeks?

I'm sorry if my question seem obvious, but I don't have access to the administrative interface, as I'm remotely helping a few friends who is testing the system on separate locations around the country. So I'm thinking out loud.
