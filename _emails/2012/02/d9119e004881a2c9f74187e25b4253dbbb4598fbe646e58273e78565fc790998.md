For some reason the instructions we followed where not clear on the fact that this system overrules the existing system. It takes DOWN the local network, and replace it with it's own configuration. Meaning the existing network on 192.168.x.x no longer worked.

Ah. Yes indeed, something should be said about that. I guess because the 
instructions are from a "nothing" system, I didn't think about stating 
that, but I will. The FAQ is easy to throw it in, but I think it should 
be in the instructions as well. When you are installing from 
instructions, do people read the whole thing first, or just jump in? 
Should it just be a big warning box at the top?

Thanks
