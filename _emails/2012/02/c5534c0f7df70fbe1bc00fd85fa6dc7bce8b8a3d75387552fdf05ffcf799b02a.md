Hi Oscar.
Not a stupid question at all.
For now, changes to squid.conf.grase aren't supported, but I hope to be 
able to support them in some way in the future. (If you do make changes, 
backup your changes so when it gets overwritten, you can revert the 
changes you need). Ideally, I'll be making a dansguardian package to do 
the filtering, and let squid just do the proxing. Before I released 
Grase, I did use Dansguardian infront of squid, but took that out before 
the release due to it being difficult to setup Dansguardian and adjust 
its filtering (and some people wouldn't want the strict filtering I was 
using).

The reason the OpenDNS is blocking things, is because the default DNS 
server the Grase Hotspot installs with, is the OpenDNS family filter. 
You can change that in the Admin interface, under network settings. If 
you don't want this filtering, you can change the DNS servers to your 
own ISP servers, or to the OpenDNS normal servers. You can even setup 
OpenDNS so you can customise the filtering it provides.
The 2 reasons I defaulted to OpenDNS family filter, is that firstly it 
provides a reasonable level of filtering out of the box, which is useful 
for people new to setting up any filtering, and secondly, it provides 
"good" DNS servers that we can rely on being stable. It's not uncommon 
to setup a router for a client, and discover that ether the upstream 
modem's DNS server, or the ISP's DNS server, do funky/dodgy things and 
end up causing half your problems! (And this was also the reason for the 
grase-conf-squid package change recently).

I hope that helps.

Thanks

Tim
