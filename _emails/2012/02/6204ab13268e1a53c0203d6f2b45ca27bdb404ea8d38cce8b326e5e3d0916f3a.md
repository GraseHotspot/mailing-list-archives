Hi. I'm currently away so can't give you much help.

Basically, by default all incoming is blocked, but outgoing is permitted 
if they are logged into the network. So what you need to do is prevent 
outgoing, in particular on port 445. Some simple firewall rules in 
/etc/chilli/ipup.sh should assist you.

Sorry I cant be more help. I'll be around later in the weekend and see 
what I can do for you.

Tim
