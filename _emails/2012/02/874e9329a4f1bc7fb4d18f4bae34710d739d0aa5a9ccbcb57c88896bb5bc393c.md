Are you getting any errors in the squid logs?
The last squid change was a one line to force it to use the dnsmasq 
server on the hotspot, this shouldn't have stopped ACL's from working 
(other than the fact it overwrote them).

What I'll do shortly is allow you to place all your customisations in an 
external file for squid (http://trac.grasehotspot.org/ticket/58) so you 
can put ACLs in there that won't be overwritten on update.
