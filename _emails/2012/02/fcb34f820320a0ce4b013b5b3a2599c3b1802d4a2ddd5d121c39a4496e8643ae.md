Thanks for that. I'll do some more testing on that, they shouldn't have 
been lost. What were the group names? It's possible they contained 
invalid characters, which can't be upgraded seamlessly. (And if they did 
contain invalid characters, they weren't working anyway, even if they 
displayed in the admin area).

Curious. Is this selecting a limit in the drop down box, or typing a 
limit? And if typing, have you set the drop down box to be blank?
