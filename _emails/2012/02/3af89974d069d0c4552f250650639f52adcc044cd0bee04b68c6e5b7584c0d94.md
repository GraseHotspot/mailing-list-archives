{% raw  %}#56: Ability to have "slave" access points
---------------------------+-----------------
 Reporter:  tim            |      Owner:  tim
     Type:  enhancement    |     Status:  new
 Priority:  major          |  Milestone:  4.0
Component:  Other Backend  |    Version:  3.7
 Keywords:                 |
---------------------------+-----------------
 Need an easy way to setup "slave" access points.
 Most likely needs a 2nd VPN (or could run off the main one with
 permission?)
 Needs to only run chilli, and maybe a web server on the slave. Chilli
 would connect to Freeradius on the master which would handle everything.
 Master needs some way to register each slave, and keep track of them, give
 them a different ip range for example. Any customisations of the login
 screen should be available to all slaves, etc.
