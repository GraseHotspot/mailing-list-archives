Sorry for the (BIG) delay. I'm currently in the process of moving house, 
so don't have access to internet, or my development computer.
Thanks for requesting a team, it makes it easy for me because I can just 
tick approve and the rest can be done by you! If you wish to request a 
Nynorsk team, I'll approve it but won't include it until it's actually 
translated. I've approved the Norwegian Bokmal team, I believe you just 
need to upload the translation, uploading the pot file should be all 
that's needed. (Or I'll fish it out of the moderator queue when my 
development machine is setup).

Again, so sorry about the delay. I look forward to including your 
translation!

Let me know your preferred name for the CONTRIBUTORS file and if you are 
ok with your email address being in there. (Normally it's in the pot 
file anyway)

Thanks heaps

Tim
