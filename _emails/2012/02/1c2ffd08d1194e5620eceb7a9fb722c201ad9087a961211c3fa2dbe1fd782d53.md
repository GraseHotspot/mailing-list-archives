No problem. I only asked as the grep you did on the cron.d directory 
showed the grase-conf-nginx package was installed. I've not said much 
about the nginx package as it's still mostly in testing, so was hoping 
someone was using it and would give feed back.

When you say fixing things in shell, does that suggest that there are 
some difficulties in setting up the system? Please do give me feedback, 
as the aim is to have it very easy to setup and get running.

Thanks

Tim
