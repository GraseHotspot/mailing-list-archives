Hi Antonio.

This is possible, but outside of the original design of the Grase Hotspot.
Ideally, you'll need to install coova chilli on your routers, and set 
them up to use your Grase Hotspot install as the central server. Easiest 
way to do this would be to create a VPN (OpenVPN is ideal) so that all 
the clients can connect securely via the VPN, to the FreeRadius software 
on the main server. You'd also need to setup Coova Chilli on the routers 
to use the Web server on the main server, and there are some functions 
regarding that that haven't been tested that could need some work. 
Lastly, the network settings you set in the Grase Hotspot admin 
interface, won't propagate to the "remote" routers, and you probably 
don't want them to. Ideally each location would have it's own ip range. 
You'd probably remove the Squid redirection lines from each router, as 
running squid on each router wouldn't be ideal if they are lightweight, 
and using the squid on the main server would be stupid. This would 
remove the ability to monitor what sites clients are using, but that's 
probably ok for this setup.

Trying to protect the LAN's at each site would be a challenge. Ideally 
you'll need a firewall rule that blocks connections leaving the router, 
that are destined for any address on the LAN, unless it was the internet 
router. (And as said above, each site would have it's own "Grase" ip 
range, that didn't conflict with any other site's Grase ip range, or 
with the local sites LAN ip range).

Limiting bandwidth and connect time is easy. Create a group with the 
relevant bandwidth limits, and connection time limit (daily 1 hour for 
example), and that will be enforced across all sites. i.e. they could 
use 30 mins at one site, 30 mins at another site, and that would be it 
for the day.

For 100\u20ac, you'll be fairly limited on router hardware. I'd check out 
what hardware CoovaAP (http://www.coova.org/CoovaAP) runs on, and use that.

The hardware I use to run routers the complete system on them come out 
at more than 100\u20ac, but would be a viable option for you if you can 
increase the budget.

I've opened a ticket (http://trac.grasehotspot.org/ticket/56) for making 
this easier to setup, as in the future I'd like this to be something we 
can offer easily.

Tim
