## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}As some of you may have noticed, 3.7 was pushed to the repo a few days ago.
Changes are below.
Some features are only implemented as a basic feature for now, and will 
be expanded soon. For example, Admin levels currently don't have a gui 
for changing users, but the backend code has been written and is active. 
PDF Labels currently don't give you any options for label sizes as a gui 
page hasn't been written. (Feel free to submit label size settings for 
the labels you wish to use so I can include them, you'll find examples 
in the PDFLabels class).

You may also notice that group names may look odd in some pages, that's 
due to some sanitation of label names as certain chars break javascript 
and SQL queries (badly). If you have any groups that had spaces, or any 
char that wasn't alpha numeric, I recommend you delete it and recreate 
it, and move all users from the old group into the new one. This bug 
could prevent a user being logged out when the group limit is reached!
