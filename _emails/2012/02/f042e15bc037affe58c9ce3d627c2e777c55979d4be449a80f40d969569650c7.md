Please try updating all your grase related packages. I've found a "bug" 
regarding squid and DNS that should be fixed. It seems some upstream DNS 
"proxies" (i.e. cable modems) don't always return the correct results 
for squid, causing squid to hang trying to resolve the site and hence 
the internet appears to not work. As I don't personally have a faulty 
modem, I'd only come across this problem once, and for that client I 
just forced everyone to use dnsmasq on my gateway. What I've now done, 
is force squid to use dnsmasq (that we already force all hotspot clients 
to use) which gets around faulty DNS proxies.
(After updating, it's wise to reboot)

Let me know then if you are still having problems.

Tim
