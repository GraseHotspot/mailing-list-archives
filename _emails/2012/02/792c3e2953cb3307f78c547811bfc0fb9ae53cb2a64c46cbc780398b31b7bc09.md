This is actually a planned feature!
As part of the feature, I plan on adding a new table for recording all 
payment transactions (for record keeping) and also allowing you to make 
a "cash" payment when you create a user. (Not sure how to process that 
for batch users though).
The "groups" we currently have are going to be changed slightly, so that 
you can "sell" a group. This will be where you set a price.

(btw, paypal has an alternative url you can use for sandbagging).

My timeline for this was supposed to be in the next 2-3 weeks, however I 
have gotten caught up with other business this week and so have lost 
essentially a whole week. (And still have some server migration to do 
before the end of the month).

The current feature timeline is to cleanup the PDF tickets (allow 
customisations etc), then paypal payments. Suggestions of other payment 
gateways would be appreciated, so I can make it customisable.

Thanks for letting me know that it is a needed feature!

Tim
