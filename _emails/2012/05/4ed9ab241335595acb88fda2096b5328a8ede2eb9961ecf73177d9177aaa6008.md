The Grase Hotspot installs with Squid as a transparent proxy. Using 
other proxies isn't supported at this time. Is the non-transparent proxy 
upstream from the hotspot? If so, you just need to tell Squid (on the 
hotspot) to use the "parent" proxy.
There is no way to put the proxy details in the users browser (there is 
a kinda way, but it's flacky at best, and not going to work enough to be 
useful). Just stick with the default proxy that is installed with the 
hotspot.

This sounds like it could be a proxy issue. I'd reverse your export 
http_proxy you've done and go with a stock standard install first to see 
if it works, then you can play from there.
