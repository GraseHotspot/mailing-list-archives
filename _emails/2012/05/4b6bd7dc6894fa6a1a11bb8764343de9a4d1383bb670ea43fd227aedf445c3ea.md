Hi. 9.04 is too old sorry. 10.04 LTS was previously supported, but due 
to it's lack of Squid 3.1 isn't supported ether.
It should work with 10.11, 11.04 and 11.11. I've got to make a new 
release to support 12.04 and will do that soon.
Debian 6 is also supported.

We do have a small issue with some distros as the i386 and the amd64 
versions were compiled with different libssl (for the Coova Chilli 
package). I will have that fixed for the next release. Do a quick search 
back through the archives to find out the best combinations.

Let us know how your test goes. The few bugs we have atm regarding which 
distro and which version haven't been fixed atm because I'm short my 
development computer. So if you get stuck with an install, please ask 
for help as it's probably that issue.

Tim
