## Raw message

{% raw  %}
Just thinking about it, as a workaround you could setup additional groups that will have an expiry in 2 days weeks etc and assign users to that group... 

I have also noticed that when running a speedtest from host to speedtest.net i get 20mb when i do the same test through the hotspot i get half the speed... User is not limited to a speed... Is the hotspot limited in what it can allocate a user speedwise?

For example, some users have hard coded DNS settings, which will work once they are logged in, but might not work before hand. So basically, in testing, it was decided to use ip address (which is very common for captive portals) for reliability.
