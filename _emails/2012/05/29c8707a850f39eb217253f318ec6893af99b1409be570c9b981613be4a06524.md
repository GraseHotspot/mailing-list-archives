## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}In my opinion it would just look more professional... Without ips and shortening the url... Its not to discredit the grase trademark just would look nicer...

For example, some users have hard coded DNS settings, which will work once they are logged in, but might not work before hand. So basically, in testing, it was decided to use ip address (which is very common for captive portals) for reliability.

So that we can package it up without it interfering with other packages on the server (i.e you might want to run a website off the same computer for the local intranet), we only "hijack" urls below /grase/. (See the Alias in the Apache conf file). While you could have 2 aliases, one for /radmin and one for /uam, there are a few files and directories in /grase/ that are shared between them, and some of them could easily conflict with a website on that host.
