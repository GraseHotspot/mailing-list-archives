Hi Salvo.
The Hotspot isn't making a "bridge", it just treats everything
"upstream" of the server as the Internet. Your hotspot users shouldn't
be able to access the wired lan, unless they are authenticated for
accessing the internet.

If you don't wish for the hotspot users to have any access to the LAN,
you'll need to add some firewall rules. I'm not able to give you any
specifics right now, but essentially you want to prevent outgoing
packets from the hotspot server, to any LAN machines, except the
upstream router. Depending on whether the Hotspot server itself needs
to communicate with the LAN will determine how you need to construct
that rule.

I'll try and provide examples when I can. Hope that helps.

Tim
