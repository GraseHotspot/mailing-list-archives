Not currently. I'm actually looking at writing my own distributed 
service that people will be able to use for a monthly subscription. 
(It'll also make for lighterweight "hotspots" as the heavy lifting is 
moved to my servers in the cloud). I'm planning on having a "run your 
own server" system as well.

Just go into the user and click unexpire. Expiry is mostly for when you 
want to limit a user to a period of time (i.e. 2 days for someone 
staying at a hotel/motel for 2 days) and to assist with clearing out old 
users (as expired users are cleared after a few months)
