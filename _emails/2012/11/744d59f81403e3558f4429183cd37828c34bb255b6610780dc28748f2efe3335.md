Hi Mario.

The Grase Hotspot currently can't handle everything you want it to do. 
It's best deployed on a single server, that has multiple wireless access 
points connected to it. However, in the near future it will support 
multiple servers, which will help with your multiple broadband connections.
Is the reason for multiple broadband connections for bandwidth, or just 
due to distance?

I do think that Grase Hotspot will be the best option for you, but 
you'll have to wait a bit longer for the multiple servers version.

Tim
