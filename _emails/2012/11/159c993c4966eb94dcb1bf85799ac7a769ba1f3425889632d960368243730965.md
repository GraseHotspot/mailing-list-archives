## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Darren,

As an alternative work-around for your issue, you could set up a cron job
to periodically reset the guest password back to default. I currently use
this method as I have a public guest account with an advertised username /
password but also have private individual users with faster access who want
to keep the "My Account" user-facilities page.

If you edit /etc/crontab and insert the following line, it automatically
does this every 5 minutes, where DB_UNAME is the database username,
DB_PASSWD is the database password, YOUR_GUEST_PASSWORD is the user
password that you want reset to and YOUR_GUEST_USERNAME is the username for
the user (change these to your values):

*/5 * * * * root /usr/bin/mysql -uDB_UNAME -pDB_PASSWD -Dradius -e "UPDATE
radcheck SET radcheck.Value='YOUR_GUEST_PASSWORD' WHERE
radcheck.Attribute='Cleartext-Password' AND
radcheck.UserName='YOUR_GUEST_USERNAME';"
