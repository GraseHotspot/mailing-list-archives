{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

I can see that Grase is set up to cater mainly for time-based accounts  (
similar to how ISPs would provide dialup hours). It seems that adapting it
to suit monthly expiry/quota based accounts (similar to how ISPs provide
broadband plans) does pose challenges and needs some thought.

I think that giving Admin the ability to manually adjust an individual
user's expiry-date is a flexible and powerful tool to manage various
scenarios with  expiry-based accounts. If this function is liable to be be
used incorrectly, a help/warning text could be included. I'm certainly
finding that expiry based account management on my set-up is easier now
that I've got this functionality.

I can confirm that I still works that way (Its a trap for the unwary that
already caught me).

I think that its fair enough to reset expiry to the group expiry when the
user's group is changed (obviously) or when adding time (as it is clearly a
time based account). But I don't think that it should  happen in the
background when changing or adding data-limits as it messes up expiry based
accounts (like I use). I've commented-out the offending lines in my own
set-up.

I also think it would be a good idea to log all expiry changes  as thy
occur (and include old and new expiry dates).

Good idea.  If the button clearly indicates that it will "Update Expiry to
Group Expiry", the  current expiry could be displayed in a text entry field
(rather than as normal text as at present), able to be edited and updated
on clicking the "Update User Details" button.

There are a few issues here.

My regular monthly users want to keep their usernames. They get 1 month of
access and a data-quota for the month. At the end of the month, if they
renew, both of these limits are reset.  Until you fixed the 4Gb bug (thanks
for that!!!), I would reset the user's data-usage to zero (by archiving it)
before allocating their month's data-quota. Now when I reset the expiry at
renewal time, I don't have to archive, but I do have to look at the user's
"data-remaining" and top it up to reach their data-quota for this month. So
its a bit complicated especially if accounts are renewed early or for many
months in advance.
A calendar application with notifications helps keep it together.

Maybe the way to go is to have a new class of user who's accounts all
roll-over on the 1st of each month and to have a cron job to do the above
tasks based on the expiration set for the user?

Cheers,

Bob
