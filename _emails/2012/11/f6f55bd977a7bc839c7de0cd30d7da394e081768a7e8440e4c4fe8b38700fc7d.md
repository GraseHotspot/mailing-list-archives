## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I've been evaluating Grase Hotspot for a while now and I think it is great.

I'm encouraging my friend to use it to manage his wireless network, but he
has

a requirement that I don't see how to set up. Basically we want to be able
to set

a recurring monthly data limit, similar to how we can set a recurring time
limit

for a group.

 

Am I missing something obvious, or does this require new development?
