Hi Santiago. Sorry  about the delay.

Sounds like you found the download? If you hadn't already worked out, 
there is no "final" release. You download the package that setups up the 
repository, then it installs all it needs from the repository.

For monthly limits, look in the group section. You apply this to a group 
(recurring time limit), and then put the user in that group.

There is a landing page as you'll have hopefully discovered by now. It's 
the login page. Currently you can't change it to another page, but maybe 
in the future you can.

Users can't currently buy their own accounts. However I've been actively 
working on this feature, and have it working on my development machine. 
In the next release there will be a "vouchers" section where you can 
define a price and what that actually purchases. Groups will still be 
used to set lots of the voucher settings though. This will eventually 
include a Paypal API, as well as other API's. It's plugin based so you 
can always write your own gateway.

I hope that answers your questions.

Tim
