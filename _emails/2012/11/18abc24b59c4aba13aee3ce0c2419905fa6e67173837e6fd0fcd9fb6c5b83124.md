## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Just posting this again as the first message disappeared off the end of the page.

Is there a way to remove the link that allow users to access their user password
so only the admin can change it and not the user?

We have one user account for all public users, but someone keeps logging on and changing the password which is locking everyone out.

Thank you,

Darren
