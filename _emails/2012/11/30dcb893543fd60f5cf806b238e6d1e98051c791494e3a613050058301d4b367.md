## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hey Bob.

Expiry Date was one of those things that used to get used incorrectly, 
so it's current setup doesn't suit everyone.

Some things you might not know about Expiry, is that it's updated when 
ever a user is changed. So for example, if you add more data, it should 
be updated (at least, it used to be, can't verify right now). In most 
setups, Expiry isn't used to control a users account access, but more to 
help cleanup the system of old "expired" accounts. Often users are being 
controlled with data and time limits. Understandably, when you don't 
want to limit a user in that way, but give them a set number of days 
they can use the account, you need to use expiry.

Also, when a users account is "expired", a button appears allowing you 
to renew their account. Maybe I just need to have that visible for 
"updating" the expiry based on the group, at any time.

Of course, the use case of people booking ahead is a little harder, as 
is when you need to add on more expiry. I might need to find a way to 
allow us to purchase "days" in the same way you'll be able to purchase 
time and data in the new vouchers.

(If you could please open a ticket, I'll remember to do that)

How would that sound for most of your use cases, where you can ether 
refresh the expiry based on the users group, and also have a new 
category of users who purchase "days", and for them you can add more 
days to their account? (The use case of booking ahead, will need a "not 
valid till" field as well, which I believe we can do.)
