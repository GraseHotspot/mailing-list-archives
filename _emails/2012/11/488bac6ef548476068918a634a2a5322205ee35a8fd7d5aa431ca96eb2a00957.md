Currently there isn't a way to do this that prevents them changing the 
password. Ideally you just need to disable the usermin section. To start 
with, in the Portal Customisation part, hide the footer link, which 
takes away one of the links to managing the account.

Easiest way though is to remove usermin.php out of the 
/usr/share/grase/www/radmin/ directory (and you'll need to do that again 
after an upgrade).

File a ticket and I'll look at a better way of locking a users password.

Ideally, you'll want automatic ticket creation which is coming soon. So 
each users device is automatically allowed 15mins or so without needing 
to login.
