## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thanks for the quick response.

I'm on version 3.7.6. In the Groups section, above the Recurring Time Limit
field I've got the Default Time Limit field.

>>From what you are saying, I guess there is a more recent version. Where can
I find it and how can I force an update?

 

Thanks.

I've been evaluating Grase Hotspot for a while now and I think it is great.

I'm encouraging my friend to use it to manage his wireless network, but he
has

a requirement that I don't see how to set up. Basically we want to be able
to set

a recurring monthly data limit, similar to how we can set a recurring time
limit

for a group.

 

Am I missing something obvious, or does this require new development?

What version are you using?

Right above recurring time limit in the group, should be recurring data
limit.
