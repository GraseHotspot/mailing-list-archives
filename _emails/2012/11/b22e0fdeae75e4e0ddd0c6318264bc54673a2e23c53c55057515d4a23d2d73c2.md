One of the problems I have with not having enough time to develop, is I 
forget which features are "in the wild" and which aren't. Monthly 
recurring limits seems to be in the unreleased version, soon to be 3.7.7.

If you are brave, you can find the changes in the bzr repository and 
apply them to the groupconfig files (template and groupconfig.php) and 
you'll be on your way until the next release.
