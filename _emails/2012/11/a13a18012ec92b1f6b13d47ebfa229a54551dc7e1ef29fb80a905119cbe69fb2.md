Hi every one,

1. The solution to your problem is to change the DNS from grace network 
setting to your IPS DNS, make sure you delete the other the present dns 
and replace it with your isp DNS,

2. If that alone did not help also change the grase IP  10.1.0.1, to 
your own most time i use 192.10.10.1 and it has always work for me.

I hope this solve your problem.


Thanks
