## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thank you so much for this fantastic bit of software.

We are currently trying it out to see if we can use it at our Gallery & Museum to let our visitors log in to the internet as they move around the building.
To make this easy for us to manage we would like to setup one user account and password for the public to use which we have achieved, but the problem is that anyone can change this password to stop other people using the login. Is there away to remove all the links that allow users to access their account page so the user password can only be changed by admin?

Thank you,

Darren
