## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Drazen,

 I did change the setup but right from the administration page because you
told me you had the grase server setup as such.. I can change it back no
problem, I do have an AP device which i tested, but still having problems..
The weird thing is that when i connect it straight to the Wan side, i get
the repeater to work with no problem. The only thing i'm having problem is
when i connect the repeater when the router or access point is connected to
the ubuntu server..
The access point is 3 in 1, what i can do i guess as final test is one that
has only two interfaces and use that as an access point and see what it
does. . Weird thing is when i use two separate wireless with two different
ssid and i connect them in bridge modoe (lan ports) or i guess it can be
called using them as switches i can connect to either one with no problem
at all. and i can also connect to the internet.
