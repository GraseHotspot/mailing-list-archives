## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim or Drazen,
 i tried with a regular access point and repeater, and still having the
same issue, the issue i get when the repeater connects, other than that, i
have no trouble at all.. i tried diff repeatres sstill same problem.. I
wonder if the problem is with the network card on my computer since i think
i have hte access point section on an old nic card... or does that has
nothing to do with it . I really need to get a repeater working soon and i
dont see how to.
Alsok, does anyone in the list know if i can use dd-wrt setup of hotspot
and just use the freeradius on the computer? I was thinking of maybe trying
wpa2 enterprise
THanks again
Santiago
{% endraw %}
