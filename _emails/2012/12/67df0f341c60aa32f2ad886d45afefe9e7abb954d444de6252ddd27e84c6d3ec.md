Your problem is that you are doing Layer 3 routing instead of Layer 2. Each
"router" needs to act as a pure Access Point, with no ip routing occuring.
This means that you need to disable DHCP on all the routers, and any
firewalls and NAT. All the "router" should be doing is "bridging" the
wireless and wired networks at the Layer 2 level (Layer 3 is ip addresses,
Layer 2 is MAC addresses).

Thank you Tim 

Could you please explain more 

Shall I assign static ip for each router or put it as dynamic? 

The network as I mentions SERVER {IP 192.10.101.1}- - network Cable- Router
{IP 192.10.101.2}- network Cable- Router {IP 192.10.101.45}- - network Cable
- Router {IP 192.10.101.25}
The other question about upgrade , am I gone loose the customization I made?

Appreciate your soonest feed back
