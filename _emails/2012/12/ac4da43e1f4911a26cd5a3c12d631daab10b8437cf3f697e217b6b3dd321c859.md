## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Do not Know why, but I think i'm track Here.. I used my new 3 in one as
access point and an old repeater as 'repeater" seems to work so far... Next
step will install dd-wrt on old router to see if i can use old router as an
AP... and may be test the repeater again... Dont ' know why the router in
bridge mode or dhcp disabled does not let me do it... will continue to see
more debugging.. Another thing i saw, i kept getting 10.1.0.2 as my lan ip
address when i had the repeater connected to the ethernet port (using it as
client bridge) ...
{% endraw %}
