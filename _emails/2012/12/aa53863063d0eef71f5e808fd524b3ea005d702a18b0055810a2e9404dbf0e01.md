Your problem is that you are doing Layer 3 routing instead of Layer 2. Each
"router" needs to act as a pure Access Point, with no ip routing occuring.
This means that you need to disable DHCP on all the routers, and any
firewalls and NAT. All the "router" should be doing is "bridging" the
wireless and wired networks at the Layer 2 level (Layer 3 is ip addresses,
Layer 2 is MAC addresses).

and it consider them all as single user….

What is happening here is that the router is "routing" instead of being an
access point, and so the grase server can't see the clients behind the
router, it instead sees the router as one client, and that one client
happens to invisibly share it's internet with all the clients connected to
it.

This has been fixed in the 3.7.7 dev version which is currently waiting for
more people to test it before I release it properly. Have a look back in
the list archives 2 weeks and you should find instructions on how to test
it.
This was caused by a limitation in one of the other pieces of software
underneath the hotspot, so has been a major change, so all the testing we
can get is appreciated.
