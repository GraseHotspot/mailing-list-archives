## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Drezen,

    I just tried your configuration, I got an access poin (3 in 1 ) access
point instead of router, and using an old repeater, same problem, link
connected but can't access internet nor the grase server. i can work fine
with the straight to wired router though, so how did you say that your
setup was working this summer on grase server?
Please let me know
i'm running out of ideas lol.. i do believe that it has something to do
with the dhcp server somewhere though or idk may be something about Mac
address translation w/ the repeater? i can't think wht it could be since it
works fine without the ubuntu server, but it doesnt with it if you know let
me know
Santiago
{% endraw %}
