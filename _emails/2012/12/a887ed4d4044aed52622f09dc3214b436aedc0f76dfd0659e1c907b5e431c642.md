## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Tim,
  My wired Router setup is as follow, the wired router is connected to the
modem so wired router ip is 192.168.0.1, the "wrieless router no
dhcp/*bridge Mode*' is connected to the wired router Setup ip is
192.168.0.14 DHCP from wired router is from 100 - 255 ... and the repeater
connects to the access point..repeater config ip is 192.168.0.12 i
believe... I change it depending on what i need. but should work, it works
with the wired router.  That configuration I have no problem at all
connecting.... Now, with the ubuntu server, The Access Point connected to
the Ubuntu server, *bridge mode* no dhcp setup ip is 10.1.0.11 and repeater
setup utility is 10.1.0.12 is there something wrong there? also,w hat is
the DHCP table on grase? and can I change it and how??.. i was thinking it
could be an ip  conflict.. but not sure..
{% endraw %}
