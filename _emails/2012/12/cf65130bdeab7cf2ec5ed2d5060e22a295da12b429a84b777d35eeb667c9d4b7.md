{% raw  %}Hi,

I'm in the process of reviewing many captive portal solution and have tried
the Grase installation but wanted see whether anyone has used in it in the
following manner, or can help me with some customisation work based on the
following requirements.

I'm looking for a scalable captive portal solution to provide the following
functionality.


   1. Support multiple customers. Each customer may have one or 100 hotspot
   locations. Each customer must have individual registration page and branded
   welcome page. It would also be nice to have location base service for each
   individual hotspot (registration page, different welcome page for venue
   promotions etc)
   2. User registration must to be a branded page and must capture the
   following information, including MAC address and venue location (AP name
      1. Name
      2. DOB (DDMMYYYY)
      3. Post code
      4. House number
      5. Mobile Phone (to be used for portal login)
      6. Email address
      7. Gender (M/F)
      8. Password
   3. Once registered users must validate the account via SMS code, or
   something similar. Must be a quick process
   4. MAC Authentication - Once a user has registered and account validated
   they will automatically be authenticated via MAC address captured during
   registration
   5. Returning users will automatically be MAC authenticated - No
   username/password required
   6. Registered user can have fixed number of devices per account, eg 8
   devices
   7. Any new devices connected to the wifi will receive the registration
   page however the user can select "I already have an account" and the user
   can login using their mobile phone number and password and register the
   device against the account. It would be nice to name each register device
   on the account eg. Ipad, Mobile phone1, Android phone etc..
   8. User Portal - users must be able to access their registration details
   and devices via a web portal e.g. http://www.freewifi.com/users
   9. Customer Portal - Customers must be able to access a customer portal
   to view venue reports eg. Number of overall registration, or per venue,
   number of sessions, report by gender, top 20 sites visited etc (maybe
   option to use google analytics here)


If the above customisation is possible can you provide cost and timescale
please? I'm very keen to find a workable solution as quickly as possible.
