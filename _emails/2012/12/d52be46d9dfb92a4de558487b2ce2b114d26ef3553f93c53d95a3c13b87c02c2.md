{% raw  %}Santiago,

AFAIK you need to use the Atheros devices for a  mesh topology. Thats
the only experience I have anyway.

Of course, since wds operates at the mac address level and is fully
transparent at the IP level, you can have a hybrid setup, using a wds
link between 2 routers as a "backbone" to extend a wan connection to a
remote location, where you can plug-in any access point. The wds
routers can even be on a different channel or band from the main
network so will not interfere with whats already running .

Cheers,

Bob
