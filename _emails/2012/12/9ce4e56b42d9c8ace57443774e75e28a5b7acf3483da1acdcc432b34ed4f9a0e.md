## Raw message

{% raw  %}Drezen,
 Before going on flashing my router firmware to dd-wrt i tried what you
told me but still have the same problem. So far what i did was change the
grase ip address to 192.168.1.1 so this is the setup so far (I have a
separate router for testing) because I do not want to disturb service to
customers..

Grase Server :
 IP 192.168.1.1 (Network 192.168.1.0
Netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1

Router in "bridge mode" Brand Linksys e1200 (the one i have for customers)
and dhcp disabled
ip address 192.168.1.5
netmask 255.255.255.0
(there is no gateway option ) but it works great for customers...

The one i am using for testing, although with the e1200 i get the same
results... now i'm using a wrt160N linksys
DHCP disabled.. cables connected to Lan port instead of wan, which is wired
to grase server
ip address 192.168.1.6
netmask 255.255.255.0
No settings for gateway..

Repeater, 192.168.1.4
Brand Encore enwi-1an45 3 in one range extender 5dbi antena
setit up from wifi/ search checked system status it says repeater mode
enabled, connected, channel 4
ssid is linksys
netmask 255.255.255.0
Mac address: FC-8F-C4-01-A7-46

This particular repeater does not have setup for gateway, the old repeater
I had did had a setup for gateway, but even then, it didnt' work...
although linkstatus showed as connected (it was a linksys wre54g )

I was thinking, if the virtual interface tun0 being used instead of
physical eth1 (as i see that eth1 does not have any ip address even with
grase running) has something to do..

if you have any idea please let me know Thanks
P.S: I'm trying to install iperf as service on grase server just to test if
there is a slowdown on connection since one customer calls me with speed
going slow, although what he described seems to be his computer problem, if
he server is install would help him diagnose faster.. however, i'm having
problems connecting from my computer (on grase hotspot network) to the
server when i try it is there any firewall setup when grase is setup that
prevents port 5001 from being connected to?
if you know let me know, but that's not that important, I do need to knowo
how to do with the repeater though.
Santiago
