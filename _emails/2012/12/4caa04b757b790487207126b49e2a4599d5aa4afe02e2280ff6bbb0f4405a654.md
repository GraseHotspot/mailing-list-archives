## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}WDS stands for: Wireless Distribution System. WDS defines how multiple 
wireless Access Point or
Wireless Router can connect together to form one single wireless network 
without using
wired uplinks. WDS associate each other by MAC address, each device.
Ok. this is one way. But thing can go without WDS too.
You will need to setup your base radio as pure AP. Not bridged guess.

This setup can be tricky for some radio devices. E.g. I had troubles to 
get repeater functionality using famous linksys 54G router with DDRT 
firmware. At the end gave up on Linksys.

What you need are pure AP devices.

At the moment, I have one repeater link up with two different brand of 
AP devices, One of is pretty old.

Keep in mind the following: This setup below now is working connected 
directly to my internet router, not Grase server. However, this summer 
same setup was working connected to Grase. Just IP addresing changed 
from 10.1.0.0 to 192.168.1.0 including "default gateway" field too. 
Default gateway is Grase of course. (you should omit security as well).

Base station connected to grase (in fact to Internet router at the moment):

Compare this setup with yours. It can vary depends on radio devices and 
software. But some basic things should be the same.
