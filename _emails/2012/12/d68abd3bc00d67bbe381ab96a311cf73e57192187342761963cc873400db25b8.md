## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Can you maybe draw a picture of the setup, and give model numbers of the 
devices, and the settings

i.e. grase server (10.1.0.1/24) ---wire--> router as AP (no dhcp, static 
config ip 192.168.0.1) ==wireless==> repeater model X (static config ip 
192.168.0.2, no dhcp....) ==wireless==> computer X (gets DHCP ip 
10.1.0.5, can't ping 10.1.0.1 but can ping x, y, z?)...

That might help. And also show how your wired router setup that works is 
setup as well.

Thanks

Tim
