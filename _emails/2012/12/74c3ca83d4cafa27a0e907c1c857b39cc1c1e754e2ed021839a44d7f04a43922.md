## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Dear All wish you all the best of the season may will blessed days bring
peace to every and each one of you

 

I installed grase hotspot and it worked fine till yesterday as I used my ISP
DNS but yesterday started to give me DNS error 

 

My network goes as follow 

SEVER - TP-LINK Router [DHCP enabled using same server IP] - Edimax Router
[DHCP enabled using same server IP] - then another edimax router had it own
DHCP Range

Each router had its own IP address 

Today I discovered that if I connect or any one connect to the third router
, and if any one is already logged in its no need to log in again and it
consider them all as single user..

 

The other issue I defined the download/upload limit for some users to 40GB
but when these users reach 4GB it give user alert that bandwidth exceeded 

 

Hope to hear from you all 

{% endraw %}
