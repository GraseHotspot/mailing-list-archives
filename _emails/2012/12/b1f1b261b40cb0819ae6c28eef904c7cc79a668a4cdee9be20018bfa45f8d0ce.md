Online users will show up in the monitor sessions page. Currently you 
can't disconnect users from the webgui. I'll get around to implementing 
that in the near future.

CSV export is in the new unreleased version. Hopefully before christmas 
that'll be out. Currently you can only do exports (PDF and CSV) on 
batches of users. So if you use the batch creation of users, you can 
export them. (PDF is currently called print, but it creates a PDF).

Glad you are happy with it.

Tim
