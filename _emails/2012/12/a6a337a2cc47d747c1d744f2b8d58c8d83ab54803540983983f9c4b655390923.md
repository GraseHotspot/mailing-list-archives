## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

Testing 3.7.7.2 is undeway here!

vi /etc/apt/sources.list and add the following line:
deb http://dev.packages.grasehotspot.org purewhite main

apt-get update

apt-get install grase-www-portal
one non-critical error
"ln: failed to create symbolic link
`/usr/share/grase/www/images/logo.png': File exists"

apt-get install grase-conf-freeradius

So far, all seems to be running well. "Monitor Sessions" loads
instantly now that only current sessions are shown.  I'll avoid
clicking "Display all sessions" for now as it probably will still take
an age to load!

I still have to add back in my own (probably now overwritten) radmin
changes as  I find resetting a user's data usage to zero and manually
inserting their expiry date to be an incredibly easy way to manage
rolling over my monthly/quota based users (even though they lose their
"history"). I do love open source!

Is there any issue in leaving the dev repository in my sources.list?

Cheers,

Bob
