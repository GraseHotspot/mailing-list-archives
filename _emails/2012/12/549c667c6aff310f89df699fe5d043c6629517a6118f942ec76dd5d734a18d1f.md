## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Does anyone in the List know this?.. I believe is because i'm using the
router in bridge mode, or no DHCP, but when i try connecting a repeater. so
i can extend the range, for some reason, it doesnt work. the repeater
connects to the access point, i can acess both the access point/router
setup webpage, but i just can't navigate the internet, not even to the
grase portal. If anyone knows how to fix this, would be greatly appreciated
Thanks
{% endraw %}
```
