## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Other than my recommendation to never use a wireless repeater as they 
reduce bandwidth...

Can you confirm, that a computer connected to the repeater, gets an ip 
address from the Grase server? If it does, then can you confirm that it 
can access the grase server via ip address? If it can't, then there is a 
issue with the wireless access point and router.

Also, how is it acting as a repeater? Is it connecting to the wireless 
access point as a "client" and then serving out a new wireless signal? 
What may be happening is that the repeater isn't doing proper layer 2 
routing, and so it "hides" all the computers on the repeater. This means 
to the access point, and the Grase server, it appears as if all the 
clients on the repeater, are actually one client with the repeaters MAC 
address. If this is the case, it's impossible to use the Hotspot in this 
situation.

I personally never use wireless repeaters so can't give much help.

Also, I believe that a WDS wireless "repeater" system should work 
without any problems.
