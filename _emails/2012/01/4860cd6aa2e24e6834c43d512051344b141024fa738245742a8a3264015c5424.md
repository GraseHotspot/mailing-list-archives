Subject: [GRASE-Hotspot] squid / dansguardian

Hello,
I’m configuring squid in my server. I’ve added some things to squid.conf.grase like the block list sites (porn) but I think that there are hundred and hundred of sites. I’ve filtered by words too but it could be so hard. And I couldn't filter p2p.
Then I've looked on the Internet that there is a plugin for squid called dansguardian and there are blacklist for dansguardian (http://urlblacklist.com/).
My question is if I can install it or If I could have problems.
I say that because I've installed grase hotspot in Debian and perhaps if I install Dansguardian some components could don't work.

Any advice?
Thanks
