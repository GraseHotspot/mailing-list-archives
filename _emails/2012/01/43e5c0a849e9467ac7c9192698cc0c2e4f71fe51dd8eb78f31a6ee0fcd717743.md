I believe I understand what you are describing Muhammad.

The issue sounds to me that you don't have Layer 2 going across the 
"Wireless Bridge". Can you give me more details as to what settings the 
AP5Ghz-1 and AP5Ghz-2 have, in particular how the wireless bridge is 
setup. And the remote AP's what the settings are for them? As long as 
everything operates at layer 2, then it should work. However wireless 
bridges typically operate at Layer 3 which is causing the issue.

What is the ip address and gateway that remote computers get when 
AP5ghz-1 is connected to switch 2?

Tim
