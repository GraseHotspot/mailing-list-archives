This is a bug to do with startup order that I'm trying to figure out. 
Can you post the results of  'ls /etc/rc2.d/'

When you install the hotspot, we override which config file squid3 loads 
so we don't have to worry about the file that was installed being setup 
poorly. So yes, squid3.conf isn't useful while you have the hotspot 
installed. If you fully uninstalled the hotspot later on, and still had 
squid3 then it would start to use the squid3.conf file. If there is 
enough demand, I'll add an "include" directive to the squid.grase.conf 
file so you don't need to edit that file (and risk changes being 
overwritten) but can include your own user options. (If you want this, 
just open a bug at trac.grasehotspot.org)
