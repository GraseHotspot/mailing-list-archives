This message is fine to ignore. Until I sign your VPN key, the vpn will 
fail to start.


You'll be happy to know I found the bug that was causing the problem! It 
so happened that after doing an uninstall and reinstall of the packages, 
I saw the bug. The error message you got about smarty wasn't helping 
because the error was way before there, and that error message was 
actually a bug in the Error handling code! I couldn't understand why 
you'd be getting that message, but now I do!
So a small fix in another piece of code, a few small changes to the 
error handling and I've fixed it. The release with the fix should be out 
shortly.

Tim
