## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim,
I've tried to install grase hotspot in UBUNTU SERVER AND GUI 11.04, 11.10, 
10.04 and I'm not be able to do that.
Firstly I install the server, then I install the LAMP and finally I install 
the grase hotspot. And I obtain always the same bugs. As I told you when I 
reboot the server it gives to me some errors like:
"Syntax error: [in error.tpl line 3] Syntax error: block function is not 
implemente. (Smarty _Compiler.class.php, line 720) in 
/usr/share/php/smarty/smarty.class.php on line 1093."
Afterthat when the server restarts I obtain some errors like dnsmasq and vpn 
has failed. And if I tried to do service chilli restart I get the messages 
that you can see in ubuntu_chilli file.

I've always followed all the step from your instructions and I don't know 
where the mistake is.

Finally I've tried to install the grase hotspot in a nootbook that I have (I 
only have one network interface), but I've changed the o.s. I've installed 
DEBIAN 6 and I think that more or
less it's working. I think that because when I start the server I get the 
following message: "virtual private network daemon: grase fail"  and when  I 
reboot the server I get "php warning: Invalid argument supplied for 
foreach() in /usr/share/grase/www/radmin/networksettings.dnsmasq.php on line 
93". Although if I make service chilli restart, it starts correctly.

I've done that you say to me (dkpg -l) about my ubuntu and debian too. (you 
can see files ubuntu and debian)

Sorry for this long email.

Could you help me?

Thanks

Whoops. Gmail sent my message!
If you can show us the packages you have installed (dpkg -l smarty*
php*) then it would help if it's a version problem. I have a 11.10
machine I can test next week.

As for the ip address problem, I know the cause know, I'll commit a fix
soon.

Tim
