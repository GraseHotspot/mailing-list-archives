## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}>>From time to time
i am having issues with adding data to a user.

I have a group with no data limit.
Lets call this group A and has a time limit of +1 Month
Now user 1 has no limits. except bandwidth speed
i allocate to them 3gb of data. and 2 or 3 weeks pass and they request
another 3 gb
now the time limit is expanded for another +1 Month and Data has extended
to 6Gb
problem is a 1week later they reach 3gb of the original limit and they
receive Data limit Reached

Even adding more data to the user ie 2gig they still recieve the error.

Is there something wrong or a known issue ?
{% endraw %}
