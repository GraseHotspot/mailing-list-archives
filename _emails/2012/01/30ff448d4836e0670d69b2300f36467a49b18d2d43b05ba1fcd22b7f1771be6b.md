{% raw  %}#52: Reports are skewed by CoovaChilli Admin user
-----------------------------+-----------------
 Reporter:  tim              |      Owner:  tim
     Type:  defect           |     Status:  new
 Priority:  major            |  Milestone:  3.9
Component:  Admin Interface  |    Version:  3.7
 Keywords:                   |
-----------------------------+-----------------
 To Allow settings to be stored in radius, we have a CoovaChilli
 "Administrative" user that the coova chilli process logs in with. This
 logs the entire session, so we end up with double accounting in reports.
 Need to filter this user out of reports and all other places.
 (Might be able to use it to give us an idea of what is flowing through the
 hotspot currently though)
