## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}The site where I have installed the hotspot have been a lot of problems of late, which I think i have identified as an issue with the DHCP server in their router.  I have just assigned static addresses to all their Windows 7 PCs because they kept falling off the network. I am pretty sure that it is the dhcp at fault because the hotspot keeps dying and doing an ifconfig tells me it has the wan address 127.0.0.1 Rebooting it can fix the problem ( I guess restarting the right services would have the same effect.
Can you tell me if it is allowed to set a static address on the wan port and if so how I would go about doing it?
Thanks in advance
