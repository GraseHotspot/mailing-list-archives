## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi everybody, hi Tim.
Recently I made two installations of Grase, at home and at work. For 
curiosity, one is running on ViaEpia miniItx with CPU C3 1Ghz (an older 
model) and second one at Intel/Atom miniITX. Both installation runs 
several AP devices on LAN side by use of switch box.
I will skip glorification of your work Tim, since it is assuming. That 
is why I am here.

First I noticed that splash window will not popup automatically whenever 
any network program at client machine try to request internet address. 
E.G. Skype, mail client as two most important ones.
It is assumed that when any program trying to reach network/internet 
destination, hotspot should response to start client's default browser 
automatically and then bring up splash login page.
This is tested by XP/W7/Linux and Android clients.

My appologize if this topic already discussed earlier. I am new at this 
list, not feel comfortable with it yet.

Regards
Drazen
