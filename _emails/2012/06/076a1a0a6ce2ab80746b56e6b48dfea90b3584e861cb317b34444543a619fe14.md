## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}#73: Delete expired users probably doesn't always work
---------------------------+-----------------
 Reporter:  tim            |      Owner:  tim
     Type:  defect         |     Status:  new
 Priority:  critical       |  Milestone:  3.8
Component:  Other Backend  |    Version:  3.7
 Keywords:                 |
---------------------------+-----------------
 The delete expired user code is supposed to delete users 2 months after
 their expiry.
 The line of code
 {{{ $timepattern = strftime("%B __ %Y 00:00:00", strtotime("$month
 months")); }}}
 Appears to only get expiries that expire at midnight. We need to check if
 this catches all expired or not, and make sure it catches all expired.
