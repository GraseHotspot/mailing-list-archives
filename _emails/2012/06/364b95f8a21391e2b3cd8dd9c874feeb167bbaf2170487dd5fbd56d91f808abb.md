## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Ok, for everyone out there, this is now a known issue. Grase 3.7.3
WILL NOT install on Ubuntu Precise, due to a newer MySQL version.
If you really want it to install, find the SettingsMySQL.class.php
file (/usr/share/grase/www/radmin/classes) and find the line (88 i
think) that has "TYPE = MYISAM" and change it to "ENGINE=MYISAM".

3.7.4 (when released) and later will install without a problem. For
some reason, one of the Database schema's had TYPE= instead of ENGINE=
(I assume older MySQL allowed it) and so it hiccups on that.

As stated previously, the next release is delayed due to me having had
my computer die. A replacement computer should be along shortly so I
can finalise the release and put it in the repositories!

Thanks for the patience everyone.

Tim
