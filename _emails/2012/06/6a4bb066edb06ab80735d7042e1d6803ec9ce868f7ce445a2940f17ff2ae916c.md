Hi Hanno.

I really don't know. I don't remove anything from the coova-chilli
tree, I only add in our patches. Your best bet is to ask in the AirOS
forums. I would be interested to put Grase on an Airloco, however it
doesn't have enough resources to run everything we currently run. Your
only option for AirOS is to put the coova-chilli part on it, and the
rest on a server that they can access. I believe there are already
firmwares for it that are like that.
Othewise, buy me an Airloco and I'll see what I can squeeze on it!

Tim
