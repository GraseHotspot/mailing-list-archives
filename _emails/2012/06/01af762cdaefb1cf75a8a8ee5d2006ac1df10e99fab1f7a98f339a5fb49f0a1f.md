You can write and link your own modules in freeradius without having to alter the core code.

Thankfully I do speak C, so will probably just patch rlm_sqlcounter
which is where the problem appears to be. (The MySQL database can
store the numbers fine on both 32bit and 64bit systems). I really
don't want a non-standard module, so patching the rlm_sqlcounter is
the best way forward, even if it doesn't get included in upstream for
sometime.
I believe some of the work was done in freeradius 3 to fix the
problem, just not enough.
