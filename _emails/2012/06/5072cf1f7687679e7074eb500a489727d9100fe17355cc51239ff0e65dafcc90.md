Hi Glyn.
It sounds like the DHCP server has failed somehow, so you'd need to
restart the networking services and hope the dhcp server answers.
Static IP makes most sense for sure! I recommend DHCP as the majority
of locations have DHCP already running and it makes it plug and play,
but it is just a router after all, so static is fine, you can even do
routing instead of NAT if needed!
See http://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration#Configuring_the_interface_manually
for some pointers on how to setup a static network card. Make sure you
set it up for the correct WAN port, as the wrong settings will stop
everything from working!

Assuming you are using Ubuntu Server or Debian without Network
Manager, you'll have a line like "iface eth0 inet dhcp" already in the
interfaces file. That's the one you'll want to be changing to static,
and gateway is important!

Let me know if you get stuck, and show me your /etc/network/interfaces file.

Tim
