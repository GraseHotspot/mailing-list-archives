{% raw  %}#74: Translation of forms and other uam functions are slow due to loading libs
----------------------------+-----------------
 Reporter:  tim             |      Owner:  tim
     Type:  enhancement     |     Status:  new
 Priority:  minor           |  Milestone:  3.9
Component:  Splash Screens  |    Version:  3.7
 Keywords:                  |
----------------------------+-----------------
 Most php scripts in uam have require_once('includes/site.inc.php') at the
 start. This is needed to load settings and to be able to translate files,
 etc.

 Find a way to lighten this considerably, as each request has 300ms of
 overhead just loading all the libraries!

 Possibility, as most of them are just for translation of templates, to
 write a new light template translator that we pass the language to in the
 GET request, so no loading of libs to read settings is needed, and we just
 need the translation code. Check if Smarty is still good if we are just
 doing translations, or if a quicker method is available.
