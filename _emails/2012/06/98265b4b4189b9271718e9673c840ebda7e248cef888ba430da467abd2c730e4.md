## Raw message

```
{% raw  %} 

1.  I restart with service chilli restart and i tried to restart computer
too nothing work

2.  I dont comment out the masquerade line 

3.  I tried to change the dns server in squid but not working 

 

You think an upgrade to dev version may fix the problem ?

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Just checking, did you restart the hotspot between changes? (at least

with /etc/init.d/chilli restart)??

Best to reboot between changes.

 

1. Seems to suggest that it's not an upstream DNS issue but maybe dnsmasq

 

2. Check you didn't comment out the lines under #MASQUERADE, maybe

send me your ipup.sh file so I can check

 

Also, try changing the DNS server that squid uses. Search for

dns_nameservers 127.0.0.1 in /etc/squid3/squid.conf.grase  and change

to 8.8.8.8 to test. Remember to restart squid after making that

change.
