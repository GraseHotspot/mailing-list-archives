Then you are not packaging correctly. (I'm a Mandriva and Mageia packager, so I think I'm qualified to have an oppinion on packaging)
On Debian, those cron scripts are also removed by a simple "remove" command. On every other package I've removed in Debian systems, it has also removed the cron scripts it installed without the need to use "--purge".
This is a packaging problem, and you need to fix this.

Besides, A crontab is /Not/ a config file. There is a difference between the cron daemon config file and the scripts cron runs.

This location is a 10 hours drive away, so I wouldn't know. ;-)=
I'm a Mandriva / Mageia user myself.
