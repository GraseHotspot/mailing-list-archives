I asked other Debian packagers, and the suggest was for you to purge it. :/
As I said, it would be nice if we didn't need the Cronjob just for
updating network settings that happens so rarely. The alternative I
had originally thought of, was to use sudo to allow the webserver to
kick off a script, or suid. However nether of these sit well with my
from a security point of view. A daemon running constantly just to
check is also not ideal. I'll investigate other options, so
suggestions are welcome. (I can't remove the file in the postrm, as
then a reinstall won't add it back, as it's a conffile and so assumes
the user removed it for a reason). I can probably install the file
"magically" in postinst, however it's not the recommended way, so I
wouldn't want to do it as I hope to have the packages in Debian at
some point (or at least fully compliant)
