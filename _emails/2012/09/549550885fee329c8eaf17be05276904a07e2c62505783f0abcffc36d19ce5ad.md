Hi Antonino.

We really do need something in the admin interface to help people with
backups. Currently backups happen nightly, and are saved in
/var/backups/grase. There are 3 files each day, one for each database,
and then a tarball of both the database backups. The backup script can
also email these offsite with a small modification.
Other than the database backups, if you need proxy logs, you'll need
to setup your own backup system for them. Other than that, everything
you need should be in the database backups.

My plans are eventually to have an admin section where you can have it
email you the backups, and also delete old backups (currently backups
aren't deleted). Any other suggestions are welcomed.

Tim
