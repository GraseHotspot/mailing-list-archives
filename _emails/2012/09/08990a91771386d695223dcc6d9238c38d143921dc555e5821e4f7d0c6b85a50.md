I am using firefox mainly. But at the different machines and OSes 
(xp/suse/android), don't have same behaviour. Means don't have "java 
script error" at every combination. Seems that to many sessions causing 
some time out with browser java script what depends of browser 
version/os combination and believe with speed of grase server.

However, I have also to many sessions. Mainly because of one client 
computer which has permanent acces via wifi. That PC is networked by 
external AP device set as client. The mac address of this device is 
taken as computer account with grase. Since PC as well AP-client device 
are always on, there are to many timed out sessions generated with this 
account. Guess that I should correct this setting in the future. This 
was setup only work at the time. But this is on me.

Anyway, it will be good to collect more informations about number of 
sessions with different installations of grase and then see if 
redefinition of session query is neccesseary.

I can send you list of my sessions e.g. Together with more such examples 
you should be able to analyze wider range of what is going on.
