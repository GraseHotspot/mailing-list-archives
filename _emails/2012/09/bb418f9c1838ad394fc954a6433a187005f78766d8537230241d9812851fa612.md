Due to the way that the users data usage is stored (sessions in the 
radacct table), it's really messy and unclean to try and reset it back 
to zero. In the edit users page, there is the ability to "add" data and 
time to the account. This is the preferred way of allowing users to keep 
their accounts while still renewing. Does this allow you to do what you 
want? If not, why?

Thanks

Tim
