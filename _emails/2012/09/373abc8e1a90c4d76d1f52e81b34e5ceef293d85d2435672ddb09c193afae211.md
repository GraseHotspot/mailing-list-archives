## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

I'm using Firefox 14.0.1 and yes, there are a large number of sessions
listed, currently 521 to 1972, so a total of 1451 sessions!  The vast bulk
of them are session which have been closed,  with only 8 currently open
sessions.

How can I limit the number of sessions shown under "Monitor Sessions" or
can I set it to display only "open" sessions?

I'm also looking forward to it being "possible to have master and slave
nodes", as you mentioned in another thread. I presume that this is ticket
#56 and that that it entails running the coova-chilli access-controller on
a remote router/machine  and having it access grase/freeradius via the wan.
Is that right? Would you be able to explain the changes needed in any more
detail?

Thanks for your help.

Best Regards

Bob
