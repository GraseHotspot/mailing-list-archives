## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hi Tim

Thank you for you advise. This will be a good optiin if its rolled out as use woukd have chance to expand their wireless to the public. Would you know whether this is a limitation for coova as well since their requirement does state 2 NIC?


As for the subscription, i'm actually subscribing but maybe i did it wrongly.

I'll try and put another request.


Best regards-Norman

Its not currently possible to set it up in the way you are describing.
However, this is something we are working towards. If you have a look
in the bug tracker (trac.grasehotspot.org) you'll find a few tickets
related to it.
