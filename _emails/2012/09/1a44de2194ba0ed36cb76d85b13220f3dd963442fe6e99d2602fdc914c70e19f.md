It /should/ be authenticated whenever someone tires to use the internet 
through it. When it first connects to the wifi, does it get access 
without needing to login? If not, then you've made a mistake with the 
mac address.
Computer accounts can "timeout" but should login again automatically 
when they try and use the internet. I'll give it a test soon, but it 
should be working.
