{% raw  %}Hi, please subscribe to the mailing list.

See http://trac.grasehotspot.org/ticket/39

Currently not possible. I do have a few ideas of how to implement it,
but it's not simple which is why it's not currently been done.

Ideally you want a voucher to have an expiry even if it gets a new one
at first login, because you are usually selling an item at a price,
and so expect it to be used at that price. If the price later goes up,
those who have 'bought up' can keep using their items "forever".

Ideally, you want vouchers to have a long enough expiry to be sold
before they expire, but short enough that there is incentive for it to
be used.

I would like it to be a bit like SIM cards here in Australia, they
have an "activate by" date, so that old sim cards aren't lying around
for years taking up potential numbers. So the vouchers would ideally
have an "activate by" date which is the normal expiry we have, and
then at first login a second expiry is applied.

The biggest hurdle is the "first login" part. Its very easy to have a
section for activating vouchers, before logging in, but that's not
really user friendly.
