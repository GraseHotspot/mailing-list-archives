And would allow login details to be sent over HTTPS as I could buy a 
cert for that domain name. (Not that we really need SSL as we use CHAP 
anyway so the passwords aren't in the clear). Currently we can't do 
that as a) you can't get SSL certs for intranet ip's/hostnames anymore 
(being phased out 2015), and b) most people don't want to buy a cert 
but want it over SSL, go figure.
