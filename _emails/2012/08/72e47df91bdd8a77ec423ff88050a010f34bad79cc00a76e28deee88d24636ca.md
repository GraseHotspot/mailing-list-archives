{% raw  %}#81: Make prices less connected to time/data and have Price based tickets/topups
-----------------------------+-----------------
 Reporter:  tim              |      Owner:  tim
     Type:  enhancement      |     Status:  new
 Priority:  major            |  Milestone:  3.9
Component:  Admin Interface  |    Version:  3.7
 Keywords:                   |
-----------------------------+-----------------
 As pat of #30 and #42, we should disconnect the data/time limit from a
 price.

 Ideally tickets will become:
  * Group dependent for "global settings"
  * Have a price set for a specific "ticket" with a data/time limit
  * Have topup tickets (only within a group) for adding to an existing
 account

 This would allow for example, to have an initial ticket of 100Mb cost $10,
 then topups of 100Mb only cost $5. Allows for less linear pricing.

 Most tickets would be added through a process, of selecting the ticket
 type you want (and if it's a topup or not) and then going through the
 payment section, which could be any payment gateway as allowed by the
 system, and implemented via plugins). For manual ticket creation, the
 gateway would be an admin authenticated saying you have paid (and the
 ability to override the payment to something else).

 Normal user creation would still work as is, with the difference that
 prices would no longer be shown in the Data/Time drop down boxes
