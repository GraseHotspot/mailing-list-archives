## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Drazen.

This is currently unsupported, but will be supported in the future.
Currently the captive portal on the hotspot isn't setup to allow
clients coming from outside of the local captive portal. It should be
easy to do in the future, but as I've not played around with it at the
moment, I can't give you much guidance.

Sorry.

Tim
