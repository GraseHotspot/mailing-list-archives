## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim 

 

Do any of you know how to solve this problem if the electric power goes down
of the computer and after 30 min he start up again after the electric is
restored.

All the clients that were logged in before power goes down and now want to
use their connection again get the login screen and when they login they get
an error massage.

 

You are already logged in on another location

 

Is there a way to reset every client individual (by admin)so that they can
login again.

 

The system seems to release the connections also but sometimes after more
than 1 hour

 

Thanks in advance.

 

Peter
