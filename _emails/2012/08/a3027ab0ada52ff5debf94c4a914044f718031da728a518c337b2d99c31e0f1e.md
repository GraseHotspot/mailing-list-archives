## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim and All,

To define dhcp range chilli uses, http://www.coova.org/node/1865
advises to edit /etc/chilli/local.conf and add;

dhcpstart 10
dhcpend 253

But what worked for me is;

dhcpstart=10
dhcpend=253

And this only seemed to work if the netmask is 255.255.255.0. For a
broader netmask I think you may need increase dhcpend above 255 (I
read something somewhere about this but haven't tested it).

A reboot is needed to apply the changes and to get chilli working
again. After the reboot, /etc/chilli/local.conf, appearsto have been
rewritten so that it looks as if you'd never edited it at all but the
changes are in effect! I've no idea how to check on the running system
what the DHCP settings are now set to so I think writing it down
somewhere is a good idea.

I made changes to the dhcp range as I was concerned about potential IP
address conflicts with my static addresses but I've now undone the
changes and it looks like Grase is doing a good job issuing dhcp
addresses to "computer account" devices which match the device static
IP settings.

Behind Grase I'm running a layer 2 mesh network, which needs static
addresses and in order to get Astrerisk (voip) working across the
network, it seems that each mesh node needs to have a Grase "computer
account" set up and to have its static IP address to be within the
shared address space. I'm pleased that Grase appears to accommodate
this setup.

Cheers,

Bob
