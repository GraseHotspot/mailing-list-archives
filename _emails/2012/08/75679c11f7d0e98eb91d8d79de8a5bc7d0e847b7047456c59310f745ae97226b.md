## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi.

First check that it has actually disappeared. It should be a file in
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ called grasehotspot.list.
Second, it may actually be an issue we are trying to work a away
around. The CoovaChilli that has been compiled needs a newer libssl in
Ubuntu, than is available in Debian, which we need to find a solution
for.
