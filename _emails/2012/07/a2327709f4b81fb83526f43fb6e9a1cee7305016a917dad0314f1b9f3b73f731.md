You can use just data limits, however that won't be data limit per day.
It's when you have "data limit per period", i.e. "data limit per day", that
you get issues. So in particular, if a user has 10Mb a day, and the day
switches over at midnight, if they login at 11:45pm, and go past midnight,
it won't automatically update their quota for the next day until the logout
and login. So another way of putting it, any limits are defined at login
time. The reason time limits per day, and time limits per week etc work, is
that generally you can't go over the barrier time without being
automatically logged out, as your time limit is up.

So using any "data limit per period" options, will have bugs until a
complete rewrite of how its handled in Freeradius is done.

That's why I asked if you can let me know how you want to use this feature,
so I can work out what the best way to make it possible for you is.
