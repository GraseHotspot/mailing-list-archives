Currently they expire X months after creation. There may or may not be
a ticket currently for making it expire after last login. Have a look
on trac.grasehotspot.org and file one if there isn't one. (Can't
remember off the top of my head atm, and I've not got time to look
into it today.). It's something I've been thinking about doing, and X
months after last activity is fairly easy to do. (There should a be a
ticket X months after first login, which is slightly different to what
you are asking).

Not currently. The reason for this is that expiry is based on the
users group. The reason this change was made, was that the original
location I wrote the software for, it was confusing being able to
adjust expires. Feel free to file a ticket and I'll look into a new
way of overriding expires.

However I notice that there is a built in CA which have your info as default, and we would like to have the Subject part of the certificate t match our organization. I have located where to change to make it happend.

The CA you have found is to do with the VPN support tunnel. It has
nothing to do with SSL, and it's not something you users can use. What
it does is allow remote assistance (once the remote-assist package is
also installed) via a VPN, as well as allowing you remote access to
your hotspot devices by installing the grase-conf-openvpn package on
your laptop for example (you'll be in the same VPN).

I do need to write some more details about the grase-conf-openvpn
package, as it's in the default list for people to install, purely for
the reason that when someone asks me to help them, the right packages
are already installed. At the time I released the project to the
community, it was still only being used by people I was giving direct
support to.

You'll find that the certificate isn't actually signed on the hotspot
ether, its signed by a CA remotely, so that information is on my
server. If you are intending to give your clients VPN access to secure
their connections, then thats a different thing, and something I've
been thinking of setting up for some time as a package, but as of yet,
haven't.

No problem. Glad it's being used! It's used here to limit some teenage
boys who would clog the internet!
