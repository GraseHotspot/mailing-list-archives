## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Upgrading to dev may fix the problem, but it sounds like a network
issue somewhere.

So users get a timeout page? Is it generated by squid or the browser?
Is the issue reproduceable? (i.e. it always happens, or always happens
after doing X, Y and Z)?

Do you feel comfortable with me doing remote assistance to try and see
what's happening? (Just install the grase-remote-assist-user package
and let me know your vpn ip address).
