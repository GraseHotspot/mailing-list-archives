## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Assuming you guys are using the latest Dev version (I can't remember
if the stable version has it, but if it did, I know there is a bug I
fixed in the dev version).

Any1500-2000 should allow logins only between 1500 and 2000 on any day
of the week. Wk1500-2000 should only allow logins between 1500 and
2000 on weekdays. Etc

Hope that makes sense. The format is fairly easy to pickup, so if you
have something that appears right but isn't working, let me know.
