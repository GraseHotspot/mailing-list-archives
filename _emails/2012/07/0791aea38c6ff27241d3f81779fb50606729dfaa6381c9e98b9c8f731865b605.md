## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Drazen.

There was some posts to the list a little while ago about the 4Gb data 
limit. It's a limitation with Freeradius, and as I've not had a computer 
for the last 3-4 months, I've not been able to even tackle it.
So far, the solution for now is to limit your ticket sizes to 4Gb. I 
know it sucks, but apparently it's been a freeradius bug for a long time.
Now that I have a computer back, I'll be trying to fix the bug in 
Freeradius so we don't have this problem.
