They should be removed roughly 2 months after expiry. If you have some 
that haven't been removed, would you be able to send me a database dump 
(offlist, as it contains passwords for your users) so I can have a poke?
Also, make sure you are using the latest 3.7.5 as it had some fixes 
regarding removing expired users.
