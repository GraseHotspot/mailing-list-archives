## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Good to know that you get it fixed so quickly because I've been wondering
why there isn't any complaint about it in the mailinglist. Maybe the next
improvement would be to make GRASE installs nicely with Precise desktop,
seems like quite a few people do that. Thank you.
