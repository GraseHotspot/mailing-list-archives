I'll look into the Data summary. It should be working. We did change the 
format slightly to try and save space, so I'll double check those changes.

We log all traffic that flows, however we can only "show" information 
about the http traffic that goes through Squid. Hence in the logs page, 
it shows 2 "totals", and total for the session and a total for the web 
traffic. There is a way to try and break down the totals by protocol, 
however the mechanism to do this generates a huge load on the monitoring 
server (gateway) and is definitely not something that will be 
implemented by default. (Think, 100's of iptables rules, per ip address 
that's active, with a cron job periodically reading the counter values 
and storing in a database.)

Torrenting is also a very resilient protocol, so if you are having 
problems with torrenting, even trying to block it might be futile. When 
we have problems with torrenting, we set bandwidth limits. :-D
