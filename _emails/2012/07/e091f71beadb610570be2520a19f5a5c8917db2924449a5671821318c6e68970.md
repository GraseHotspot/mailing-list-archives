Under Monitor Sessions, if you click on the session id (number on the 
left most side) it should take you to a log for that users sessions. 
Currently there is no "summary" for the entire user base.

This is a problem a few people are having, but I've not yet been able to 
recreate here. Can you tell me some more details of your setup to assist 
me please.
Firstly, which Debian/ubuntu version are you using, and did you install 
the Server or Desktop version?
Since you set it up, have you changed the wan/lan interfaces in the 
admin interface, and clicked save, or where they already correct so you 
didn't click save?
What "customisations" have you made to the network settings and the 
portal settings?
How are your network interfaces setup? Through network manager or 
/etc/network/interfaces? Can you give details of the setup (just put the 
contents of /etc/network/interfaces if you can, otherwise the basic 
settings from network manager).

Thanks. I hope to solve this soon.

Tim
