Lol. There were "lots" of complaints, I just silenced them a few weeks
ago. People have actually been really understanding, as I didn't have
a development machine for 3-4 months.

The next step is to make sure it installs nicely with Ubuntu 12.04,
and Debian 6, as they'll become our supported platforms soon. It's not
recommended to install it on a Desktop version of Ubuntu, due to how
Network Manager works. It is after all a "server" product, and so best
installed in a way that a user (who under Ubuntu Desktop can change
network settings easily) can't easily break the internet for everyone.

The best way to install it with Network Manager, is to setup
/etc/network/interfaces in a way so that Network manager ignores those
interfaces. Or disable Network Manager. I will look in the future to
see if I can automate more of that.

Have you tried installing it with the Desktop version?

Tim
