Changing the chillilib.js file only changes what is displayed on the 
status page. The reason the change shows things properly, is we fetch 
user information from 2 locations, one from the chilli session, and one 
from the database. It's the chilli session information that will affect 
the session, hence we try and use as much data from that when possible.

In terms of updating. Just do "sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get 
upgrade" and it'll upgrade for you. And yes, any changed files will need 
to be "restored" as Debian will overwrite all files in a new package.
