> Lets say we limit the visitors group to 512Kibits upload. Does that mean that if there are 10 visitors all uploading something, (to youtube and/or using Skype) are their combined upload limit 512 kbits or is it 512kbits x 10 = 5Mbit?
It's per user, not per group. So 512kbits x 10. It's set as part of the 
group as in most cases you don't want to be setting it per user every 
time. Same as time and data limits, we can set it to inherit by default 
be overrideable per user.

Off the top of my head, I think I have looked into a group limit, and 
it's not possible.
