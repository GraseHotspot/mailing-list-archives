## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I have faced with following issue.
Manually created user with Data limit entered say 1 GiB. After login at 
the user loged page there is a field Data allowance: 10Gb
Remaining Data : 1Gb

What is almost correct, except not clear where these 10Gb came from.

Case two
If user is initially set to 10Gb Data limit, on same page as above loged 
in user is presented with:
Data Allowance: 10Gb
Remaining Data: 4Gb
This is showed up at very first logon, what is totally incorrect.

However, at the users listing at the admin space, user is corectly listed:
Data limit: 10Gb
Data usage (M): 'whateverusageis)
what seems correct.

When user reach 4Gb, then "Data limit reached" is activated preventing 
user of new login.

I need some help around as quick as possible.





{% endraw %}
