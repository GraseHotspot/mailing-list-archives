{% raw  %}Hi Dave.

I'm really not sure what more we can do.

Based on this, the problem is somehow related to the wireless bridge.
It seems really odd that it just affects 2 sites, 2 popular sites. I'm
all out of ideas from here. If I could actually play with the system,
I'd probably find something small that I wouldn't even think of.

Try disabling squid with instructions from previous email. It should
work, I've tested it here. With squid disabled, check with the laptop
into eth0 that it works. Then put the wireless bridge back in, and
test again.

I also think it's worth trying the laptop at the end of the wireless
bridge, without the bullet access point. (So laptop on cable at the
end of the wifi bridge).

If only I could reproduce it here, I can try and work out what the
problem is. As said, I think it's a problem with the layer2, that for
some reason the packets aren't travelling over the wifi bridge
properly, and are somehow being interupted (ether going to the
hotspot, or back). Maybe the squid logs would help show which
direction. (If you put the old system online, I need to know which
session id to look at, to see the logs associated with a connection
where google and facebook didn't work)
