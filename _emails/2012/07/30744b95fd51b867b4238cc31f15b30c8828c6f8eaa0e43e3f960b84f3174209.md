## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I do have version 3.7.5 installed. Could you explain me the database dump  
and how it is done?
 
The users are marked red but no user is deleted.
 
By the way, is there a possibility to keep usage data for 6 months and  
delete it after 6 months ? It would be really important for me because in  
Austria you have to keep that data 6 months and delete it afterwards.
 
Thanks. Sean{% endraw %}
