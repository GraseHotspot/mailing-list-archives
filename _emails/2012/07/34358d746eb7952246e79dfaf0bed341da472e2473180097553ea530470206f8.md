## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Dave,
Why you have Nanos and Bullet in 192.168.1.0 range? Try to change those 
to 10.1.0.0 .
Also have you tried with only one Nano acting as AP attached to Grase 
box only?

Basically, those 198.x.x.x addresses shouldn't bother if multiple APs 
connected to Eth0 by switch. But here you have extended WLAN and 
comunication between should be correct and address range should be 
different then LAN. Grase here acts as router between two different 
LANs, so address range should be different.

If you set static from 10.1.0.0 at each Nano and Bullet, gateway is then 
10.1.0.1
At least that would be correct.
