After much trial and effort, and reading chilli source code, I have 
found it is possible! :-D
At least, it appears to be in my tests. It's not well documented, but 
the uamallowed field takes network addresses as well, however the format 
is very particular.

It must be networkip/netmask with the network ip being the actual 
network IP, not an ip in the network range.
For example, 192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0 is not valid, as 192.168.0.1 is 
the first valid ip in the range. However 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 does 
work.
You put this value in the Coova Chilli Settings page, under Walled 
Garden allowed hosts. Let me know if you can't get it working.
