{% raw  %}Hi Drazen,

The MDM just allows management of the iPads and sets up their connections.
To do this it needs and internet connection, you can see the problem for a
new student ie no internet so cant get internet connection.

Hence we set up the Grase kiosk so that students could download their
connection settings and certificates required to connect to our network. We
intended to have a walled garden just allowing access to download the
wireless configuration.

It works well but we have a proxy which requires authentication sitting
between the Grase hotspot and the internet which means students still can't
access the internet without adding proxy configurations settings which is
too complex and too prone to error for the younger ones in particular.

I need to know if there is some way to Grase to share the internet
connection after it has already passed through the proxy so that students
can connect directly without adding a proxy set up....does that make sense?

Thanks
Bret
