## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}DD-wrt: https://www.dd-wrt.com/site/
Openwrt: https://openwrt.org/

linksys: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_WRT54G_series

Basic wisdom here is to choose right device which is tested to work with 
any of above 2 router software project. (WRT54G is an example). This can 
be tricky part, since router makers keep releasing diferent versions of 
same model with very different hardware sometimes.
Good thing is that developers from both sites maintaining compatibility 
tables.
Second wisdom is that choosen router has at least 4Mb flash memory. 
Otherwise, will be not enough space to install all parts to get 
functionality you are looking for.
