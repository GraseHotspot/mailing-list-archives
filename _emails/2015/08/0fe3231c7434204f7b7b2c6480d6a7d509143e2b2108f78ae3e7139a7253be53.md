## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I'm not any kind of developer i'm more like a *hobbyist*,so please be patient 


But as a result of several tests i resume the way i understand how it 
works, (please correct me if i'm wrong).

The proxy is responsible for managing the connections from the machine to 
the Internet (the outgoing network most of the time), it can filter, store, 
manage, do many wonderful things.

For enabling a transparent proxy we need another set of configurations, 
these are the iptables rules, these will route *automagically* all the 
traffic from users without needing to configure something, they may even 
not notice it 'coz it's done from another network layer(?).

Then we have the encrypted traffic, the SSL or 443 traffic, this is another 
different story, since the SSL support for a proxy (AFAIK) does brakes the 
purpose of the encrypted traffic, since it has to be de-encrypted, to be 
checked/filtered/storaged/modified according to the proxy rules, then 
re-encrypted to be sent to the final user, this requires the certs and 
other configurations from the device connecting.
It's very much like a man in the middle attack, so then we need to be 
careful about it and the laws in out state, region, country if applicable.

Then as i read, you have installed Grase Hotspot on a *buntu 12.04 box, 
which is the release that i use for all my research.

If i understand correctly, the configurations that you download allow to 
configure the SSL traffic part on let's call it *main network*, then you 
use GRASE for the captive portal reason so people on a wireless device can 
easily get the required set of configurations to get to the *main network*, 
but since your Internet access has been already filtered/*proxied* you 
can't download the configurations files.

I think that if you match your *buntu box proxy configuration with your 
higher proxy device, using a *transparent proxy and a non-ssl site* then it 
is possible for your students/clients to access the configurations file(s), 
download them and then surf with the new configuration files to the *main 
network* and get Internet access.

But if you try to use a SSL site the you need to configure 2 layers of 
proxies, the GRASE one and then the one that feeds Internet/gateway to your 
GRASE hotspot, wich will result in a PITA.

I've been using GRASE for not longer than a week, i haven't have the time 
to test it out completely, but i see that it has this packages

grase-conf-squid3-3.3
grase-conf-squid3-3.1

So is my sincere opinion that it must be easier than expected to set a 
transparent proxy that match the *main network* proxy configuration in 
order to be able to get the files needed to configure your new users fixed 
internet network.

If i'm wrong or if i loose the point of the question please let me know :)

Cheers!

PS. English is not my mother language so please excuse if it reads a little 
bit weird :)
