## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi

I believe we are currently using the native squid log format
(http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/LogFormat#Squid_native_access.log_format_in_detail)
which allows us to use tools designed for squid logs to process them.
I.e. you can use something like sarg to process the logs.

I'm not sure where you are getting a MAC address of 00:00:00:00:00:00.
Your Free Login username is based off your MAC address. Have a look at
the users in the Grase Admin section, and you should be able to find
the Free User for each MAC, and the username it's been given, then you
can search with that.

However, maybe the first thing is to explain how the built in tools in
the Web interface for viewing the squid logs, don't suit your needs.
Then we can work on improving them.

Feel free to fork it on Github, fix things, and submit merge requests.

Regards

Tim
