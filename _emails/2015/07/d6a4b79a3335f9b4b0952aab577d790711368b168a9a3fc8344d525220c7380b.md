## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I think that whole idea behind computer account is to give those 
particular computers unlimited access. Such as server, services, 
cameras, and so on.
Group this account belongs to should be free from any restrictions.

However, it is also benefit from not entering credentials maually in 
browser page. This is desirable for staffs machines like PCs, NBs, 
phones and so on.
This feature is desirable for some VIP clients too.

Since MAC address is unique for particular machine, device or what else 
it is, I think that restrictions once applied will become a limitation 
sooner or later.  It is possible to temporary forbid particular machine, 
entering any text at "Reason...." field at user editing page and later 
you can clear that "reason" at any time.

Clearing all accumulated data for machine account is not something you 
would do every day.
I suggest you to open new machine Group , without restrictions. Then, 
move your locked MACs to new group.
This should work from 3.7.7.11 guess.
