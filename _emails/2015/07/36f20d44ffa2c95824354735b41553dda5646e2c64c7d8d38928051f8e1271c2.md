Is there any reason you are trying to manually edit the database?
In the Admin Interface, under "Coova Chilli Settings" there is a spot
for "Walled Garden allowed hosts" which is the uamallowed setting.
There is also the "Walled garden allowed domains" which is the
uamdomain settings.

Chilli should automatically restart within 10 minutes of changing this setting.

Remember the the Allowed Hosts is a DNS to IP lookup at startup, so
isn't useful if IP's change or are in a CDN for example. Also doesn't
work if the site random.com redirects to www.random.com which is on a
different IP address.

I've just testing the nightly builds, and the uamallowed setting is
working no problem.

Regards

Tim
