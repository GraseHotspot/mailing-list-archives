Subject: [GRASE-Hotspot] static IP traffic on the grase/chilli dhcp pool

Hi all,

I have a particular setup for my grase box (up and running from almost 2y
now).
today I had to extend the wifi zone to another building and so I used a
wifi bridge (ubiquiti Nanostation M5).

the radio link is done using two wifi antenna.
the antenna do use their private wifi link , while the networking is in
bridge mode with a static IP.

my GRASE/chilly dhcp range is 10.1.0.10->10.1.0.250, while the grase box
has ip address 10.1.0.1

the antenna have the static IP 10.1.0.2 and 10.1.0.3

the link works great, I can manunally ping with 0ms.

If I connect on the other side of the wifi bridge I do get a VALID ip
address from my GRASE box,
but then I cannot ping 10.1.0.1 ... I cannot connect to the internet at
all...

so I suppose chilli is blocking the traffic from IPs outside of the dhcp
range,

could someone point me out how to allow some static ip on the network?
and where is the chilli configuration stored?

thanks
