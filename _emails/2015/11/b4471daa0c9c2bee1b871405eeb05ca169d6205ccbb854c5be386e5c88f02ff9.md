VLAN's. Or multiple NIC's

Virtual hosting environments can often have multiple VLAN's, all separate,
keeping the VM's apart from each other, while only having a few NIC's to
the switches, which then use VLAN's to keep it all apart. I've actually run
Grase on a raspberry pi, using VLAN's with the WAN on one VLAN, and the
rest of the network on another VLAN. This allowed me to use a single NIC on
the raspberry pi to route everything through Grase. It does mean you have
traffic going in and out of the same NIC, but in this case the internet
connection was a slow satellite, so that didn't effect throughput.

Tim
