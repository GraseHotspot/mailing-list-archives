## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Norberto,
I am just folowing your last year instructions and can get remote 
clients to authenticate to grase and get access.
Only thing what I didn't get working are machine accounts.
They are connected to DD-WRT, they get IP from belonging range, but soon 
login aplet will pop-up asking for username password.

I can't see yet what is wrong. I am trying to explore some grase logs. 
Found nothing clever yet.

Only difference from your setup, is that all my DD-WRTs are in same 
local network. They are not from other side of any router, so no ports 
redirecting was neceseary.

Do you have any advice.
Tnx!

*Drazen *
