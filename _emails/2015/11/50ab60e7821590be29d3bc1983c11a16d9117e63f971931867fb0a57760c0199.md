## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Drazen
I agree with you.
In fact I've been waiting for some solution along those lines.
I once used Daloradius with a cloud setup just like the one you  are
suggesting but I like the simplicity of Grase for a small network. I would
love to use DD-WRT routers for Grase.
Lets wait and see.

Cheers
Antonio
