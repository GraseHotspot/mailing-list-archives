## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tomas

I'm a little stumped. On my dev machine, the database is 'corrupt'. Other
machines I've checked are fine.
The fact it happened to 2 of our machines makes me wonder what we have in
common to them.

I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the mysql version, as so far
the machines I've checked that have been fine are running 5.1 while you are
running 5.5 (and I'm running MariaDB 10).

It's also ok for that database to be empty, it should be empty most of the
time, except when running certain monthly cronjobs.

I might just make an upgrade that drops it and recreates it as innodb or
something to fix this issue for us. I think a MySQL upgrade broke on empty
tables, so it's only that table effected.

Regards
