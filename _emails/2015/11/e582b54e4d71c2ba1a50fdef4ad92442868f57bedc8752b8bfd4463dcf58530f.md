## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hi Antonio
I like virtual space too.
But my home router is bare metal, my telecom router in company is bare 
metal (cisco animal aprox 30 kg , not virtual at all haha!) , while 
company main gateway/proxy/router/firewall is also bare metal (atom 
server board two NIC integrated).
Same as Grase server which is also very real machine. Everything else is 
virtual.

However, I am investigating again theese days solution given form our 
member mr. Norberto Esteves. It was at the end of 2014. here on this forum.
The thread was named: [GRASE-Hotspot] Grase Hotspot working with DD-WRT 
routers in remote locations.

It is about remote authentification to Grase from WAN side using 
slightly smarter AP devices with DD-WRT/CoovaChilli installed.
So far so good. Just can't get machine account get connected yet.
I choose TP link TL-842ND ver2.1 devices and flashed with dd-wrt + coova

Then and only then when everything will pass well, Grase may go virtual, 
cause no LAN side needed.
