{% raw  %}Hi Jean, 

Can you confirm your LAN IP?

you wrote 10.10.1
I think you meant 10.1.0.1
But can you confirm. 

By default Grase will let hotspot users access the WAN, which is meant to be the Internet although there could be other things in the WAN as well as the internet. 
So putting the WAN interface of your Grase server on your private network is not a good idea. 

If your router supports it you could create an extra v-lan for your Grase WAN interface and have firewall rules blocking anything from that new v-lan to your private  network. So you would have 
1. Private network 
2. Grase WAN
3. Grase LAN (guest hotspot users) 

and your rules would be 

a) Private Network > Internet ALLOW
b) Grase WAN > Internet ALLOW
c) Grase WAN > Private Network BLOCK
d) Private Network > Grase WAN ALLOW
and you would keep the Grase LAN off the router altogether 


Alternatively, you would need to create a firewall rule on your Grase server to block everything to your private subnet (except your internet gateway/router).
This is a bit harder to do because you will want to have web access to Grase from your private network for the management pages of Grase. 
So you will need to allow replies only to private network.

I prefered that would be the opposite but anyway.  created Vlan to isolate the 2 network, and if I do a trace route from the LAN to any device on my WAN, that  to the ubuntu (Grace host) and is routed on my WAN.
