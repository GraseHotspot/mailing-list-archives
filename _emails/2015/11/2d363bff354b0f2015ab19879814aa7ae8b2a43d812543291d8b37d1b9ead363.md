## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Honestly if your providing a service then you shouldn't be restricting same
service unless its to prevent liability, even more so if its paid.

torrents can be a real headache but if you use limits then certainly the
user will be blocked when he/she exceed those limits.

Just saying there may be other ways around having to block stuffs. Actually
it will affect user experience and resource requirements in a negative way,
and in the end you may still fail, think of a user using tor network.
