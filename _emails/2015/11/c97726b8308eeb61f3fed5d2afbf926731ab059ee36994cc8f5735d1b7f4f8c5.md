## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}This is looking Ok, but this is not yet a guarantee that is everything 
correct yet,
Why you didn't try yet? It is quite simple even you don't have AP device 
at the moment.
It is important to understand that whole LAN network sits at the 
10.1.0.0 side will have to pass grase to connect out.
To be more clear, connect any PC or Note book with wire to grase LAN 
NIC. PC will get dynamic IP address from grase and access screen will 
come up.
It is good practice that you provide a switch here. 8 ports one e.g. so 
you can connect more devices from LAN side.
