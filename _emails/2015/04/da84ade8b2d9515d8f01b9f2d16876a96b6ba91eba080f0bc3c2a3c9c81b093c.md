## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi,

I am using a DHCP WAN and a 10.1.0.1 as the LAN side (tun0).

Ubuntu version is Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS
Release: 14.04 Codename: trusty

I used grase-repo_1.5_all.deb

The only not running now is dnsmasq.

If I ping www.google.com, it resolves properly.
But if I connect direct to the LAN port, syslogs logs eth1 link up
and chilli gives me IP 0.0.0.5

Karotu
