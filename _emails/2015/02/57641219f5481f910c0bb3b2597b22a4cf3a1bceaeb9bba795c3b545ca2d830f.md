## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Drazen,
I know that the MAC address are from my own network, because i have all my
mac address and IP marked.

I changed the "DHCP End" to 223 as you said.
The problem still exists.

In Grace admin panel :
Network Settings
LAN Network Mask : 255.255.255.0

Coova Chilli Settings
DHCP Start  : 30
DHCP End : 223

Is there a setting that i can change so that Chilli broadcast only in the
network 10.1.0.0?

I don't know what else to check.
