## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}The tun0 is the VPN tunnel, so not related. You should see eth1 and a tun0
(or tun1) with eth1 being listed but without an IP and the tun0 with the
LAN ip (10.1.0.1).

To help, the dmesg command will show you the dmesg startup logs, and
'ifconfig -a' should show you all network interfaces, active and inactive
(as detected by the system)

Glad you worked out it was a hardware issue.

Tim
