## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi guys,

I tried to update my hotspot to the latest nightly in order to be able to
use the new login page.

I did a fresh Ubuntu 14.04 install and followed the instructions for
installing the nightly but unfortunately I could not get the system to
function. The admin web interface was not available from the LAN side under
10.1.0.1 and ifconfig didn't show any bridges or devices with that IP
address.

May that have to do with the different naming of the LAN devices under
Ubuntu 14.04? What could I try to do to fix this?

For the time being I had to switch back to the old version.

Cheers and regards,
Benjamin
