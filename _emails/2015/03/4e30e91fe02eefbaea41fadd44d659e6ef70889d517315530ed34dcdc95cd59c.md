## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Domingo

Even purchasing a SSL certificate won't work. To do the redirect, you need
to be able to pretend to be the secure site. For example, they goto
https://facebook.com. The hotspot needs to pretend to be facebook.com, with
a SSL certificate that matches. You can't just buy a certificate to do that.

Regards

Tim
