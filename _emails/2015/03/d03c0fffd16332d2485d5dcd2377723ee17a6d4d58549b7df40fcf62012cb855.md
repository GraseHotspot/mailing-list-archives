## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Bob, thanks for your help.
I made a database backup, just in case, but everything seems to work just
fine.
Just a detail, the Group name has to be without space characters. I had to
rename all my Groups in 1 word without spaces (like 1st_group, 2nd_group).

Thank you.

Tim, maybe there it is a good idea to add a new menu in admin panel with
that kind of "dangerous" tips!
