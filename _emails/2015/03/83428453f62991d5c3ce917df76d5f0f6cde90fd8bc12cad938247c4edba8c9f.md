{% raw  %}Hi Tim! First, i would like to congratulate for you! Grase hotspot system is a perfect solution, thanks for it! 

I running grase nightly on a 12.04LTS ubuntu. I set it up yesterday. This is a new installation. 
After the installation i visited the system status page and i saw, the filter is not working. I check the bandwith limit and it hasn't worked. Please help me! Thanks! {% endraw %}
