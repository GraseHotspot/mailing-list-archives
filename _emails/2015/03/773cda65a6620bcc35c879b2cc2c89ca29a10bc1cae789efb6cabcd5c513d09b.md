## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tomas,

Deleting a group doesn't delete its users. I think they just drop down to
belong to the next group in the list.

But you can try this perl script which should do what you want.

Scp the file to  /usr/share/grase/www/radmin/ on the grase server
ssh into server & cd to  /usr/share/grase/www/radmin
usage: ./perl delete_all_users_in_a_group.pl GROUPNAME

This script deletes all users from the group listed in the script argument
from the radius.radcheck, radius,radacct & radius.radusergroup database
tables without archiving them.

Cheers,

Bob
