## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}

I've seen numerous request for billing and the likes. I know accounting 
will be a tedious and challenging addition but could we have just a simple 
interface for some rudimentary data storage?

Eg.

if we could have a mysql table that stores the following
username or voucher number, amount paid, date paid, comments. etc and any 
other fields necessary.

we could have a page on the interface that will allow us to select the 
particular username or machine account or vouchernumber and add a payment 
to it set the paymentdate to current with the option to change.
this would be purely data collection for now until in the future when 
further developments can be added. Maybe a few other pages that will allow 
you to browse the contents of that table or search for a particular account 
could go along with it as well.
{% endraw %}
