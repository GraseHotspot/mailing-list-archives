## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Any word from TIM?

I havent seen a response for him in a long while.

Is he OK?



I have a few questions about debugging and errors etc in the nightlies.
I have been getting issues with login, when a user tries to login 9 out of 
10 times there is an error either about TOS, server timeout, server not 
responding etc and this is usually in a flash.
computer accounts take forever to authenticate as well but that seems to 
eventually login quicker than the regular user accounts.

I would love to setup a testing area to add a few features, which i believe 
might be useful depending on scenario.
{% endraw %}
