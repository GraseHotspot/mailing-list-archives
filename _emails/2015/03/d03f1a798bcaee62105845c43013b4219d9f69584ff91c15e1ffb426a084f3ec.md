## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Domingo

Due to the way SSL works, it's impossible for us to redirect HTTPS sites.
The only way to do HTTPS redirection is by getting your clients to install
a SSL CA certificate on their computer that says you are an authoritative
CA, and to allow you to "Man In The Middle" their connections. This breaks
SSL (as it's no longer secure) and so I will not write the feature in. It
is an unfortunate downside to SSL, but security over convenience is much
better.

You'll find on mobile devices, this isn't an issue as the mobile device
will detect the hotspot and prompt for login. Some desktop OS's can now do
this as well.

Regards

Tim
