{% raw  %}Hi Edward,

Here's a possible solution for you which I use for my regular users.
Probably not so good for tickets which have ever-changing usernames.

if you insert the bolded code below into .....www/radmin/edituser.php, then
anytime you change the comments field on your Edit User page, it will be
permanently entered into the Admin Log.

Whenever I want to record something which happens concerning a particular
user, I simply enter it int their comments field.

Filtering for the username in the Admin Log will give you a history for
that user.

Hope that helps.

Cheers,

Bob

// Update comment if changed
        if(clean_text($_POST['Comment']) != $user['Comment'])
        {
            database_change_comment($username,
clean_text($_POST['Comment']));
            // TODO: Check return for success
            $success[] = T_("Comment Changed");
            AdminLog::getInstance()->log("Comment for *$username changed
to: ".clean_text($_POST['Comment'])*);
        }
