Hi John

It /should/ run on 12.04, however I've not done as much testing on 12.04.
I'm happy for you to test the nightlies on 12.04,  and will attempt to fix
any bugs to get it to work.
14.04 is supported. At our workplace, we have moved all out 12.04 to 14.04
with Mate, which means we end up with nice Gnome 2, but it's actually
maintained.

Before doing an upgrade, I'd backup your Database, but it should be
upgraded seamlessly. As long as you haven't modified the HTML files that
come with Grase, you should be fine. (So as long as you've customised to
HTML via the Admin interface). The login page looks different in the latest
release, so you'll need to retweak it after upgrading.

Let us know how the upgrade goes for you.

Regards

Tim
