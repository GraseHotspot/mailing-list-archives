Hi All,

Now we have requirement in our current project:
We use the EdgeRouter with EdgeMax as router and connect to internet. We 
have a cloud portal server and radius server. We want to all client devices 
be redirect to the captive portal in portal server when the client device 
access any website first time. after be authenticated by radius server, it 
can access any website. So I want to know if the GRASE supports this 
requirement that working with the cloud portal server and radius server. As 
I know, like coovachilli integrated the portal server, we must modify the 
source code to support it. Does GRASE support this feature and just 
install, configure some options. If not, we want to how to customize the 
GRASE to support this requirement.

thanks a lot.

Shiner
