## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Sheena

You didn't quite run all the commands, I'll list them out so they are
clear.

Can you please run the following commands on the clients and server when
it's not working, and then again when it is working. Please show us the
output of them all.

cat /etc/dnsmasq.d/network-manager
cat /etc/resolv.conf
dig @10.1.0.1 google.com

Also, on the server run (also before and after it's working)
dig @127.0.0.1 google.com

Lastly, on the server, run
cat /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

>From what you've sent so far, it's not a problem with the clients, but a
problem with dnsmasq on the server. I believe it's probably related to
network-manager. If network-manager runs it's version of dnsmasq, it may be
preventing the coova-chilli one from running. I've updated the wiki
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/wiki/Network-Interfaces
with some instructions for disabling Network Managers dnsmasq, which you
may want to try as a fix.

Regards

Tim
