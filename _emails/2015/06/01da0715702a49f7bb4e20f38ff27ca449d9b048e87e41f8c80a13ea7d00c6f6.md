## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}If this is a new install of Debian, please use Debian 8, it's the new
stable and was released a few months back. Don't download all the DVD's,
get the minimal installer, as the server doesn't need too much.

When I get a chance, I'll test the nightly in Debian 7, it should be
working, assuming you have all the normal Debian package repositories
enabled.

Regards

Tim
