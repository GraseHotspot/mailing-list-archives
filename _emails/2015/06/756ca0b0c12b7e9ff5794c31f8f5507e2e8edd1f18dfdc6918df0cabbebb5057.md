## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I can see from your apt-get update that the only Debian repositories you
have enabled are the Disks you installed from. You need the main debian
repositories enable in your sources.list

See https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList for an example. You need at least
the "main" component enabled with a debian mirror.


Regards

Tim
