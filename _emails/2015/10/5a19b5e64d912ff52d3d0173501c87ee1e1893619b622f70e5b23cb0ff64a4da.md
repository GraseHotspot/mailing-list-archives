## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}As I said Eliot. This is an issue of the session timing out. You'll need to
increase the session timeout (and then restart the hotspot to ensure it's
taken effect).

For most use cases, you don't want a hotspot to remember a user after they
have walked away. If the user is a regular, then maybe a machine account is
more appropriate. Idle timeout is to ensure that if a user has a time based
voucher (i.e. for 10 hours), and walk away from the hotspot, it logs them
out instead of continuing to count down the time while they are away from
the hotspot.

Cookie based remembering is a little difficult, because we do an initial
"login" with the users MAC address, for machine accounts. It's not until
the user is at the login screen can we even see a cookie we have set. For
most cases were you want to remember a user, machine accounts are the
sensible option.
