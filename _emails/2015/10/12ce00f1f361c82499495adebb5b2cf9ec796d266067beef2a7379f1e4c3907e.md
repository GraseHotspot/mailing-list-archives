## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tomas

Unfortunately, the way the Radius DB is structured (It's really tables
within tables, thanks radius), it's really difficult to do this. In a
normalised database this would be easy. Trying to move from radius's
"flexible" and "extensible" schema to a rigid schema is a major job, as it
would involve rewriting a lot of the freeradius queries instead of using
what is provided by upstream.

Potentially a warning when you try and create an account that has data
already existing for it?

Regards

Tim
