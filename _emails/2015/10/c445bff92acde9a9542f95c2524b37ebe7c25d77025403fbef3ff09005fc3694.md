## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Thomas

Unfortunately this is how it's designed. Otherwise the monthly usage
reports are inaccurate (delete a user and all their usage disappears). I'm
happy for people to give input into how they want this to work, it's like
this for historical reasons. Maybe an option when deleting the user to
delete usage? And then do we just delete the recent usage, or the archived
usage?

Regards

Tim
