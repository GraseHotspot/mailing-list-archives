## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Ramiro

The majority of the custom code in the Grase Hotspot is the web interface
over the freeradius database. If you replace the freeradius database with
LDAP, the whole web interface needs to be rebuilt from scratch to work with
LDAP.

Freeradius already works well with LDAP, and if you already have LDAP
hopefully you have a tool to manage it already. If you are asking about
LDAP so you can use the Grasehotspot "db" with other systems, then it's not
something that's going to happen.

Sorry

Tim
