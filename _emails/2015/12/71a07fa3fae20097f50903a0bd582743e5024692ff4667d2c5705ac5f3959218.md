## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}There's a group  of students that's been causing problems for me by using 
Wireless Network Watcher to sniff out other users on the network and then 
changing their MAC addresses to any one of the ones they find when 
sniffing. They end up using other user's data allowance and causing 
problems for the business. I recently caught one of them and had him 
arrested but the irregularities in my other user's accounts haven't been 
fixed. What can I do to fix this?
{% endraw %}
```
