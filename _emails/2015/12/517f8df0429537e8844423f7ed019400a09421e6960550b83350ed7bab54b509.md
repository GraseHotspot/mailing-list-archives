## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hi Tim. Great to hear from you. :)

I have minor issue with upload speed. Most of my customer running on Rural 
Development Packages with speed of 4Mbps down, 384Kbps Up. Although, when 
it doing speedtest, the downspeed is great. but the upload speed delay for 
few second then start pushing up but the speed usually around 100 - 200Kbps 
only. The cap is 384Kbps for the client but most of time it doesn't get to 
the rate. Sometime, while uploading, it go halfway then hang. This can be 
noticed when uploading pictures in Whatapps. My client need to retry a few 
time before the images is uploaded.

My Master management computer connected directly to the PFSense, so there 
was no issue in the upload. 

Still, i'm guessing this might be caused by multi-connection internet.

as i mentioned, My line using balanced multiple internet source and still 
running on ADSL. So, my download is great per connection at 8-10Mbps.  
Although each of the line Upload link is limited to 512Kbps only.

So, my internet core is balanced;

Download : 240-300Mbps
Upload     : 15Mbps

My my upload speed is the issue when it's on high traffic.

*Next year then i have access to Fiber Core as i just manage to deal with 
my local Telecom Provider.
