## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim. 

Thanks for your great idea. 

I've done the testing already. It is the per connection balancing issue. 
when single connection is made, only specific chosen gateway is used, but 
when 2 or more connection is made, it capable to utilize the other gateway 
too. :)
Download won't be an issue since the speed is okay even for single 
connection. and most of time, loading pages and ddl use more connection in 
one time too. 

This is okay for now. My isp won't provide balancing over ADSL conection, 
but i manage to make every user able to use the line. :D
This will be resolve when i got my Fiber connection next year. After have 
the fiber line, i will do testing too. I let you know how is the 
performance afterward. :)

Anyway, thanks for your great work Tim. :)

Best Regards from me.
Jerren
