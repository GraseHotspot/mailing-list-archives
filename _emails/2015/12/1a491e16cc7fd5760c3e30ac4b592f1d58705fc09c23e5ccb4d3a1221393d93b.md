## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi!,

I'm trying to set up a Hotspot for ~80 up to 100 users.
So far the software side works fine with the 10 daily users, but i need to
change the AP since it won't meet the expected workload of 80 users.

I'm planing on extending the signal with omnidirectional antenna, maybe
sharing load using 2 AP but if you could recomend some tested one to work
with i would highly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
