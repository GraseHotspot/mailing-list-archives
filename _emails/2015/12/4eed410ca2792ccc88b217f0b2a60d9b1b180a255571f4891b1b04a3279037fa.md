 Hi JB
It would be great for you to try the RC for version 3.8 and let me know if this continues to happen for you. I'd love to get to the bottom of what's causing it, but haven't got enough information to know why Freeradius occasionally stops. I have a few embedded systems with low RAM that don't seem to have any issues and have been running for years.
Regards
Tim
