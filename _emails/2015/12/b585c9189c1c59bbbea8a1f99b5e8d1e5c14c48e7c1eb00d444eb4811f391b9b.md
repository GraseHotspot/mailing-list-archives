## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Uh! This is CISCO.
Make mi sick.

There should be web interface to set this thing up. Expect to be more 
easy then command line. I just saw manual for this thing (500 pages of 
pdf, and it is not necessary all or enough)

As I can see those are interfaces only. Since there is a one bridged 
interface (can't understand which real interfaces are bridged) but this 
interface has IP, assume it is bridge between Ethernet and radio. (There 
are two radio interfaces. Think that they belong to two different radio 
bands. I don't know if they can work together at same time or only once 
is active at the time.

Afraid you will need to study Cisco manuals by yourself or more quickly 
find some Cisco expert to explain you shortcut to what you need. Basic 
needs I explained before.
