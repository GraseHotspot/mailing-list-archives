{% raw  %}Indoor or outdoor?

Most APs are omni already.
Stronger antennas will rise up signal strengths as well the speed of 
communication in both way, but it has nothing to do with number of 
concurrent clients connected at AP.

Each antenna declared with higher gain, 5, 10, 15, 20 ... dbi will have 
better performance in Rx as well Tx direction (Receiving and 
Transmitting) then lower gain declared antenna.
But there is a trade off.
Each gain improvement means better in one or several directions while 
making worse in other.  V-H radiation diagrams are important here.
E.G. vertical stick with gain 9dbi is omnidirectional, but it has very 
narrow angle in vertical pane, and still 360. (Like lighthouse)

However, today modern APs which are declared to have higher data speeds 
(150Mbps, 300bps ... ). Besides improvement in CPU/RAM part, there is 
also special handling with radio signals which is spreading trough more 
then one antennas build on AP board itself or as external sticks or even 
combination of integrated antennas on board and one or more sticks on 
housing.
There are improvements in 801.11 types 'n' and 'ac' protocol, where 
better handling radio signal with more antennas of same source.
I admit that still don't understand how it works. There is some unclear 
facts too: What is the meaning of 150 or 300Mbps speed if Ethernet 
interface is still 100Mbps? Has not much sense other then "marketing"

Back to you.
For serving many concurrent clients you will need more CPU/RAM power 
inside AP or divided among several APs.
You can place more APs at the same place (or mast) with "sector" 
antennas oriented in different directions, making a full 360 degs. or 
less coverage circle.
In such scenario, it is important to set each AP with same SSID and 
force them to different radio channel.
Set them 3 channels apart from each other would be quite good. It is 
necessary to take in count foreign WiFi signals (channels and their 
strenght) nearby.

Same SSID will provide seamless clients roaming between different APs 
without interruption.
