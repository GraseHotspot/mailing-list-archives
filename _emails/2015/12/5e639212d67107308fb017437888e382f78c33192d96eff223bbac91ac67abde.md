## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Lets go basic check.
Leave that AP out.
Can you connect your desktop or notebook by wire to grase LAN side?
When you do that, your desktop/notebook network card must get IP from 
grase in range 10.1.0.xx
(this will NOT happen if Grase is set up wrong, or your desktop card has 
static preset)

If OK, when you open browser you should get grase log-in page.
You will NOT receive login page if your network card MAC is already 
registered computer account at grase.
In both cases, with log-in or without, you should reach internet. You 
should reach grase web interface too:
10.1.0.1/grase/radmin/

If everything as explained I would say that Grase setting is ok and it 
is working correctly.

Now the most probably, your AP is doing DHCP. It should be turned off. 
Check this detail and try again.
