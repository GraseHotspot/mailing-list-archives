## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}We don't actually use the DHCP from dnsmasq, we use the DNS
functionality. It's tied into the Admin interface where you can choose
upstream DNS servers, OpenDNS filtering etc.
If you are running the Hotspot with dnsmasq disabled for DNS, then
some features will not work.

Regards

Tim
