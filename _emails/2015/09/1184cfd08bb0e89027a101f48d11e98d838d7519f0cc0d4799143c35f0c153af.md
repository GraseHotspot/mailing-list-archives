## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi James

Can you please confirm that you are using the username admin and
password hotspotadmin? You are trying to login at the radmin interface
(http://ip/grase/radmin/) and not the user login
(http://ip/grase/uam/)?
Can you reset the database (radmin) with the file found in
/usr/share/dbconfig-common/data/grase-www-portal/install/mysql and
then run the cron job (http://ip/grase/radmin/cron.php) and ensure it
gives you some output about updating the database. If you don't get
any output, check the PHP error logs.

Can you show us the exact login error message you are getting.

Also, which version of the Hotspot are you trying to run, on which OS?

Regards

Tim
