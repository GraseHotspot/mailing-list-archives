## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}In Daloradius and Citiix solutions there were one field "pin" as 
authentication option at the new user creating level.
Have handy Dalo installation  with vbox. I am checking right now.
After adding new user found filled database and fields as follow:

RADCHECK:
(values in fields are inside '    ')
normal user/pass   example
id:'3'    username: 'peter'    atribute:'Cleartext-password' op:':='    
value:'123tArs365'

'pin' user example
id:'4'    username:'1234'    atribute: 'Auth-Type'     op:':=' 
value:'Accept'

According to this there is no password at all. Radius recognise user 
'1234' and knows that he don't need password.
Is this correct?
If yes, hope it helps.
