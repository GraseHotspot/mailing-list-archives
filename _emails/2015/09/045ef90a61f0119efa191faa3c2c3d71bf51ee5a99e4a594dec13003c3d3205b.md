## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Joseph

As has already been mentioned. The idea is that Grase clients always
query the Grase server, which then forwards the requests to the
required DNS server. You can change where the requests are forwarded
to in the Network Settings page of the Admin interface.
This does mean that in an AD environment, the clients can't update
DNS, but they should still be able to work correctly with a DNS
forwarder.

Regards

Tim
