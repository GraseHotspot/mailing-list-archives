## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}/etc/chilli/main.conf is generated from /etc/config by the chilli service 
startup script (/etc/init.d/chilli or the systemd equivalent).
The startup script calls writeconfig and radiusconfig functions.

In addition to that, there are cron scripts in /etc/cron.d which call grase 
functions. See for yourself.
