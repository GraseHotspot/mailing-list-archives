## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I’ve never used domain controllers for clients 
Im not sure that is the best way forward, but I don’t really know your environment. 

However, you can specify which DNS servers you want to use for DNS resolution by setting the DNS servers in the “Network Setting” page of the Grase admin console. 

Click on the “Network settings” menu item and then there is a section for DNS servers. 
You can set these here. 

The clients will still query the Grase server but all requests will then be forwarded on to these DBS servers.
