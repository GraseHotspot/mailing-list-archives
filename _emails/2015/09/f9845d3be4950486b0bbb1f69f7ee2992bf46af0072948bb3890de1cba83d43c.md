## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I've tried my best to write an FAQ about this.
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/wiki/FAQ#why-dont-i-see-all-websites-someone-has-visited-in-the-session-report-why-dont-https-sites-show-up

Please feel free to improve the FAQ, especially if you can make it
easier for people to understand!

The short version, HTTPS traffic doesn't pass through the transparent
proxy (and can't) so we can't log it. The methods for logging HTTPS
traffic require the user to modify their device, so I'm not
implementing them. On a side note, I also don't agree with the methods
for inspecting HTTPS traffic, as it's supposed to be secure traffic,
and I don't want someone doing online banking to be exposed to
unnecessary risks because someone wants to see exactly what URL's you
are accessing.

Regards

Tim
