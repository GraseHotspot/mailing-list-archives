## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Viktor

A few years back I started work on a system that would allow this. My
initial implementation became too complicated, and the code abandoned.
I hope after this release is out, as I restructure the code into a
proper framework, I'll be able to try again to make this work.
(https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/10)

It is possible to make your own simple script that takes a mobile
number, creates a user account (just hook into the existing php), and
sends the details via SMS. You'd then just add a link on the login
page to the "registration" script so they can register and get login
details. Just be aware if you aren't familiar with coding, that doing
this may cause security issues.

Regards

Tim
