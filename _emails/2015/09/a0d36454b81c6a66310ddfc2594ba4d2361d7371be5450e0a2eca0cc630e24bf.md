## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}The entire portal has ever been reinstalled so i ran the cron.php as you 
proposed and it *works* !!! it said mysql upgraded.
It looks so far i had a problem with mysql.

Thank you so much Tim.

grase is 3.7.7.11
os ubuntu 12.04 LTS
php reveals group invalid argument : maybe because the group table is empty 
for now.

i can continue our quest now;)

Best regards,

James
