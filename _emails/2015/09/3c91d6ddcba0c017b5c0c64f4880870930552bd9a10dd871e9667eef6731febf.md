## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Does your WiFi router have Lan ports?
If yes then
1 you need to disable dhcp in the WiFi router
2 plug the connection from your Grase PC into one of the LAN ports of the
WiFi router.
Be sure to write down the lan IP of the WiFi router in case you need it
later for administrative purposes.
