## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Sheena

Sorry for the long delay

Can you share the code you are trying to do this with? It's hard to
debug problems with custom code, without the code. Your system should
work in theory, it sounds like you may be having permissions issues
with the chilli command. Instead of using the chilli command, you can
also use the JSON interface (http://coova.org/CoovaChilli/JSON) with
browser redirects to do your logon, logoff etc. The key being to
control where the user is redirected to after each step so you can
continue to control the flow.

It's a pain that facebook login doesn't use a different domain to
facebook itself, because then you could just add that to the walled
garden. I personally would go with the "free guest login" for 5
minutes, with a big bold button informing them to use the 5 minutes to
register via facebook. Once you have them registered with facebook,
then you give them a username and password for subsequent logins.

Regards

Tim
