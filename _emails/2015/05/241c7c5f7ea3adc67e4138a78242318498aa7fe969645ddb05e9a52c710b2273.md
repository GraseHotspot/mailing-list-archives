## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}For those not aware, you can assist with the translations at
https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/grase/
If you find strings that should be translated that aren't, please open a
bug for them (ideally put lots of strings in one bug).

I'll keep an eye on Transifex as we approach the next stable release, and
ensure that I frequently update the translations into the nightly packages,
and also ensure any missed strings are added to Transifex.

Tonight's nightly has updated translations from Jose and Tomas213. Thanks
heaps guys for your work!

Regards

Tim
