## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}In my experience, the monthly recurring limit should work for this, (no
pro-rata limit) resetting the limit each month. However, due to how the
interface works, it doesn't clearly show the limit in the admin interface.
When they login, the limit remaining in the status window should be correct.
I do have tickets open to improve how all that works, so hopefully in the
future it'll be clearer.

Please feel free to test that it does work how I've said, because if it
doesn't then there is a bug.

Regards

Tim
