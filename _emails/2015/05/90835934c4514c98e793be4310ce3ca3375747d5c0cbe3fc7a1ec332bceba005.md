{% raw  %}Hi Marko

https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/39

You'll need the latest nightly version. In the Group settings, there will
be an "Expire after first login" field, which takes the same format as the
Expiry field. i.e. "+1 month" to have it expire a month after first login.

Regards

Tim
