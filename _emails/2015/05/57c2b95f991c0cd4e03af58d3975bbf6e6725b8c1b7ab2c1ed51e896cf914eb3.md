Subject: [GRASE-Hotspot] User session management

Hello everyone. 

I have a issue with grase hotspot. its not that 
is a real problem but the one that causes me issue is the user session. 
As my user logged in with their account and accidentally disconnected, 
either due to no proper logout and sometimes because of power failure 
which cause the server to off then turn on back after got current. Then,
 what happen is, after the server back alive, user cant login due to 
still active session. This is quiet troubling to me. is there any way 
for the server to reset user session when restarted or getting end user 
session option on the management page. 

Hope to hear from everyone soon. 

Big thanks to Tim for providing such a great software. 

regards,
Jerren
