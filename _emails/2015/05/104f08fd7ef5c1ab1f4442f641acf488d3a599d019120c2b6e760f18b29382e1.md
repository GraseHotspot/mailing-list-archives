{% raw  %}Hi Krishnan

In theory, yes we could do this. However, in practice it's a very broken
system. Given that it's all local content, why have a captive portal anyway?
Tricking a system into thinking it can access the internet, when it can't
can have negative effects.

If you really want to do this, you need a webserver programmed to always
return the success string required for all the different mobile devices,
and then use DNS spoofing to direct everything to yourself.
