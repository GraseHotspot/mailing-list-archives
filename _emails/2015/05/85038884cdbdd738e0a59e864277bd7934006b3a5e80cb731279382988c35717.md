## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

The general idea is that depending on the group(s) that are on-site, some 
would be provided with free internet and others would need a voucher.

Dave and I have noticed that Power Users probably should have the facility 
to enable/disable free internet access without the ability to change the 
Free Login Group settings, however at present only Full Administrators can 
do this.

Having a checkbox available for Power Users to toggle Free Internet Access 
would be fantastic, meaning they don't change all the other settings and 
only need to toggle the checkbox.

Having a security token and enable/disable URL would also be handy. On-site 
staff could then have as two home screen icons on their iPhone or iPad so 
they can quickly enable/disable Free Internet Access when roaming the 
property depending on which groups are in. The URLs could also be bound to 
buttons on an IP Phone or other device for simplicity.

I have created the feature request -> 
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/131

Regards,

Michael
