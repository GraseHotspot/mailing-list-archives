## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello everyone. 

I have a issue with grase hotspot. its not that is a real problem but the 
one that causes me issue is the user session. As my user logged in with 
their account and accidentally disconnected, either due to no proper logout 
and sometimes because of power failure which cause the server to off then 
turn on back after got current. Then, what happen is, after the server back 
alive, user cant login due to still active session. This is quiet troubling 
to me. is there any way for the server to reset user session when restarted 
or getting end user session option on the management page. 

Hope to hear from everyone soon. 

Big thanks to Tim for providing such a great software. 

regards,
Jerren
