## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Guys

There is already a batch number on each batch. I'm not sure I can see the
benefit of a ticket number, however feel free to open a feature request at
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues with some use case
examples and we can see what can be done.

Regards

Tim
