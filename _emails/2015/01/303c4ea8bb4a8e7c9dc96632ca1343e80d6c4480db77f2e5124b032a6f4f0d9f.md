## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}This check is against all the groups. It means you have a group without an
expiry.

For now, there isn't an easy way to detect only what has changed, so the
warning shows each time you submit the group page, if you have any group
without an expiry.

Feel free to open a bug on github, as it's probably a little confusing how
it currently is.
