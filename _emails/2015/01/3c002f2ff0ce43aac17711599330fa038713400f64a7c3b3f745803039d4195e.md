## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi everyone

The hosting of grasehotspot.org and the demo site are currently hosted by
me. This isn't a significant financial burden on me, as I already maintain
servers for other purposes. However, if you are considering getting a VPS
with Digital Ocean, if you signup with the following link, you get $10 and
I get $25 that goes towards the hosting of the demo VPS!

Please, only use this if you are already planning on signing up with
Digital Ocean, this is not trying to get anyone to signup who wasn't
already wanting to.

Thanks

Tim
