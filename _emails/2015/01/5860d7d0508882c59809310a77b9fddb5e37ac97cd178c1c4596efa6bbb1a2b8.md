## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim, I have had no success with this so far. I would like to know if 
there is a way of manually resetting the limit with some code and maybe add 
a button either at the Group or User edit page to reset the limit or even 
add it as a cron job.

The reason I am trying to achieve this is we have a situation where the 
hotspot is installed at an accommodation place where people check out at 
10am and check in at 2pm. We want to have each unit with a static username 
(e.g. Room01) and with a recurring daily limit of say 500mb. The problem is 
that the person checking out at 10am has already used the 500mb for the day 
and then a new person checks in at 2pm and has no internet until after 
midnight!

If this cannot be done any other suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks for your help!
Derek
