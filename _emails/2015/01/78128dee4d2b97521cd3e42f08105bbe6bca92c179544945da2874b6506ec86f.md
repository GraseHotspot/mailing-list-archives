## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}A single user with multiple logins enable will work, however it just
doesn't give you an easy way to see the different users, and you can't
apply limits to the individual users sharing that login.
With the latest nightly, each "free user" that is autocreated has it's own
limits as defined by the group, so you can restrict each user to 3 hours a
day for example.
If everyone shares a free login, they share the limit, so if you want to
limit it to 3 hours per day, that's 3 hours shared between everyone.
