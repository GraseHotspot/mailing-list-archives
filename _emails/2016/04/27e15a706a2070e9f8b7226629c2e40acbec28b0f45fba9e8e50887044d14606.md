## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}You may have to see my older posts, but anyway.
Tests made on pi2 with ubuntu 14 and an external usb to ethernet adapter 
compatible with rapspberry.
Pi2 internal lan goes to xdsl modem
Pi2 usb to ethernet goes to access point

Confirmed that tested and working great on Pi2.

I also made tests on raspberry b+ 512 with wheezy, 
You need LAMP and SSH to pre-install and then add grase.Its loading but 
coova conflicts and not starting.
I tried to recompile and reinstall but same results again, so ...
If anyone installed it successfully on b+512 may can help how to.
