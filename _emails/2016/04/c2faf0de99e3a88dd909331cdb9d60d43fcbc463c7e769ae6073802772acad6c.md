## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}MTU will normally always be 1500 for ethernet devices. 

MSS Clamping is different to the MTU.
Getting an MTU of 576 from the client to the hotspot device is not that important, you need to know what size ping you can get out to somewhere on the internet (www.yahoo.com <http://www.yahoo.com/>) without fragmentation. 

What was the result of running the pings (commands below) from a client on the LAN side of the hotspot?
You can run the same from the firewall lan if you like, but if your issue is with Grase clients then best to do it from the client. 

Then you set the command in IPTables to Clamp all packets to that size. 

The first command probably won’t give you an output but will create a new firewall rule. 
Just make sure you runt that command without the initial # (The # is just a comment delimiter from where those commands came from

Then increase by 1 until you are 1 less away from getting the "packet need to be fragmented" message again.  Add 28 more to this (since you specified ping packet size, not including IP/ICMP header of 28 bytes), and this is your MaxMTU.
