## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Shakthi

Currently we can't do this in the default installation of Grase. However
you can install something like dansgaurdian to sit in front of squid, which
allows per group filtering. This is currently beyond any documentation I
have, and was done in a very early version of the hotspot. There are plans
in the future to rewrite the helper scripts and make it officially
supported.

Follow https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/103 and
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/37 for progress

Regards
