Hmmm. email is not instant messaging service. I don't see it as useful 
as you mentioned.
If mail client is not up and running and has ability to pop up new 
message arriving, result is zero.
Status window would be best option because it is directly related to the 
service (grase in this case)

I other hand, internet services today are not supposed to be down ever. 
This is more exception then rule. So, no need to advertise any message.
With my experience with Grase, I used to restart Grase from time to 
time. This is quite quick operation that users can hardly realize what 
is going on.

If you have planned maintenance, you can advertise that over login 
screen with big red fonts, couple of days before your scheduled event.

And finally your data limit is not very attractive feature for your 
business.

Summary:
I wouldn't waste energy on messaging the cases you mentioned. Rather 
improve your site features.

Just my 2cents
Rgds.
