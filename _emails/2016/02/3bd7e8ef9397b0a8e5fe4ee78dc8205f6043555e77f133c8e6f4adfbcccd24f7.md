That would probably be the best solution.  I'd like to be able to
announce when the machine is going to go down for maintenance.  Also
alert everyone when bandwidth is short (I resell HughsNet that is capped
at 15Gb/month).  Capturing emails of everyone except free users and
having a "broadcast" button to mail to them all would be wonderful.

I can handle that.  I think :-)  I need the GUI for all the other admin
stuff plus the occasional actual work that gets done on that machine.

Thanks again for all your hard work.  We really appreciate it.
