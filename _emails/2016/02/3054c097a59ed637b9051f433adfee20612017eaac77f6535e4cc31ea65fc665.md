## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Alan

I've added some of those strings (it'll take a day or so to appear on
Transifex). Not all of them are trivial to add, and as some are for the
non-javascript login, I'm not going to put work into them at this stage. I
really don't like the non-javascript based login due to it's lack of
security, so will need to rethink what happens to it in the future.

Regards

Tim
