## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Just a heads up, that "nightly" builds are live again. 3.8.0.9 has just
been pushed which includes some translation updates, and minor fixes,
including a fix to how the cron.php script is called.

This should fix some of the issues people have had with installs when
Apache wasn't running at install time, preventing the database upgrade from
running.

At this stage, there isn't much more planned for 3.8.1, so I'll sit on this
for a week or so and then push latest translations as 3.8.1

Regards

Tim
