## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi!

I had a general question about how to improve the overall stability of the 
system in an environment where the hardware was being turned on and off 
arbitrarily. Obviously this isn't an optimal situation for anything, but 
mostly I'm concerned about any configurations that might be written while 
the hotspot is running, and the impact if the computer is shut off without 
a proper shutdown cycle. We have a couple of devices that may be plugged 
and unplugged regularly, so I'm just wondering if there are any specific 
steps I should be taking to ensure things don't go bullocksy with Grase 
(separate from all the other things that may go horribly wrong).

I love Grase, btw. Condensed hours of fighting into about 5 min of waiting.
