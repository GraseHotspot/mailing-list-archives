## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

could you please add the few untranslates strings to the UAM before pushing 
3.8.1?

The list is:

----- header.tpl
Login
----- footer.tpl
My Account
Page generated in
seconds on
using
mem
----- loggedin.tpl
Your login was successful. Please click

to open a status window
If you don't open a status window, then bookmark the link
so you can logout when finished
----- nojsstatus.tpl
Access my Account
Not available
----- nojs.tpl
Please enable Javascript to use this hotspot, or use a device that supports 
javascript
-----

It would be nice to have the UAM translation complete, as it it 
user-visible.

I also contacted you about missing translations in the admin interface. 
This could probably be postponed until after the UI rework, as - at least 
on my installations - the admins are proficient in English.

Thank you for your effort

Alan
