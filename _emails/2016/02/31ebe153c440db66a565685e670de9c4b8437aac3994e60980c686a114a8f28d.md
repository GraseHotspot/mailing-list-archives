## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi

This is technically possible, but no part of Grase has been setup to allow
this. The easiest way to implement this with Grase is to put your website
into the walled garden, so they can browse your website without logging in.
Then customise the login page to have a link to your website advising that
they can browse your website without logging in. Any time they attempt to
leave your website, they'll be redirected back to your website.

Make sure that all resources your site use are available from the server
you put in the walled garden. For example, if you use a CDN for images or
CSS, you'll need to add that CDN server as well.

Regards

Tim
