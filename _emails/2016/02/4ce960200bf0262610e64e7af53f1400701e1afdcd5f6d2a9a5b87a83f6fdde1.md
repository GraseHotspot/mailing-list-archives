{% raw  %}Hi Eliot

The problem is that Squid, while being a transparent proxy to the client,
is still being a good proxy and letting the server know it's there. Odd
that Roundcube blocks squid, I wasn't aware of it doing that and have never
experience it myself when using roundcube. However, you can make squid hide
it's presence if needed. http://serverfault.com/a/241922

Regards

Tim
