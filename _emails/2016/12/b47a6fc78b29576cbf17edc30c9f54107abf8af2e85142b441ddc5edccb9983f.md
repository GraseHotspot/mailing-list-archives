## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Guys,

I am trying to think through what would need to happen if I was to make 
Grase highly available.

My thoughts would be two Virtual Machines split over two separate VMWare 
Hosts.

In the past I have just had two preconfigured VMs - one powered on and the 
other powered off.

Could there be a way to make the tun0 IP address floating using keepalived?

For the DHCP side of things, we could split the scope in two so that the 
leases don't conflict between nodes and have the default gateway/DNS point 
to the floating IP.

The other complicated part would be keeping sessions - could this be done 
with MySQL master-master replication?

What configuration would need to remain independent between the two nodes, 
and what configuration could be shared?

Just an interesting thought process.

Michael
