## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}It appears that when this was discussed and fixed (
https://groups.google.com/a/grasehotspot.org/d/msg/grase-hotspot/oxXtQAY9MjQ/_FqiAZCRAQAJ)
earlier this year, it failed to publish properly. I've just forced publish
the fix, so hopefully if you do an upgrade on the coova-chilli package,
that'll fix your issue.
Hopefully in the next week or so the new coova-chilli packages will also be
released that I built a few weeks back, so the ARM (Raspberry Pi) packages
can also be updated.

Regards

Tim
