{% raw  %}Thank you Tim!!!

I have another question. In your experience....how you configure for
example one floor with 6 differents ap's? I have 6 ap's in one floor, but i
don't how configure this ap's, like channel, etc? I read that some many
blog's say the correctly way to configurate is put every one in a different
chanel, like channel 1, 6, 11 with the "radiation" low. You have any idea
about this? 'cause I have six floor, and one of each has 6 ap's, so i don't
what i need to do???

Any help is welcome!!

Regards!!!
