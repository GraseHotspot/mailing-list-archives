{% raw  %}Hi Vicente

The layout of your AP’s will be dependant on a few things such as building, if they are directly above each other or staggered and if you are running 2.4G, 5G or dual band. 

There are some great videos here http://www.metageek.com/training/ <http://www.metageek.com/training/>
(I have no affiliation but found them useful for myself) 

But basically, for 2.4G you will want to use only channels 1, 6 & 11 and also make sure you are not using 40Mhz channel width (Use 20MHz instead) as 40MHz will create more overlap and thus degrade throughput when adjacent to other access points. 

You want to have your AP’s placed so that they can’t hear each others radio transmissions (i.e. put adjacent ones on different channels) and adjust the power down to cover the area that it needs to. 

Using 5G is a lot easier to do this as there is a lot more room in the spectrum. 


Hope that helps 


Dave

I read that some many blog's say the correctly way to configurate is put every one in a different chanel, like channel 1, 6, 11 with the "radiation" low. You have any idea about this? 'cause I have six floor, and one of each has 6 ap's, so i don't what i need to do???

You'll just want to modify the network mask (and maybe the network IP) so be a bigger network, and then modify the DHCP range to include that bigger range. You can have 2000 ip's if you need, as long as your hardware can handle that many clients it won't be a problem.

So, i have a question? with grase hotspot, how many range we can have for given to the acces point??? For example, with this network we have the change to give arround of 1950 different ip, and that 'cause i work in a hotel with so many pax, so per the hotel has 500 or 600 connection. With the dhcp from grase hotspot, we can give the same range of ip's???
