## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thanks hotspotuser, but that all seems to apply to a pi3 with the built in 
wifi adaptor, which is not quite relevent.

My setup is as described by elliot ness and uses a pi2 with a usb eth 
adaptor for the wifi connected to a TPlink AP. I do have an update on the 
situation though.

I built a completely new system at home this week and the best stress test 
I could give it was a total of 7 phones, and tablets (both ios and andriod) 
connected as free users all pulling vidoe from youtube or bbc iplayer 
whilst at the same time using my phone (with a machine account and no 
bandwith limitations) to run the speedtest.net app. All videos worked and I 
was getting 20Mb plus on the app. I took the system to the pub and swapped 
out the original one (and the AP) last night and it seemed at first to be 
much better.  Looking at the admin pages from home it 'seems' to be bettter 
- it is up to 6 pages of total sessions and the data throughput seems 
better, but I just went to visit and on my phone (machine account access - 
no restrictions) I couldn't even access the admin page, my iPod as a free 
access user couldnt even get to the login page.  Looking at the pi over ssh 
from home it is not stressed in terms of cpu (TOP) and responds well, I 
also have webmin installed and all seems happy. but from the wifi side it 
seems very flakey. So is it environmental? is it the usb / eth adaptor? I 
am pretty certain that the Pi2 is probably more capablethan the ancient 
laptop I was using before and the new location has a twice as fast internet 
access. It is not practical to re-use the old laptop in the new position on 
site -although I do have 1 pi3 which I suppose I could use as a slightly 
better performing test bed......

regards
