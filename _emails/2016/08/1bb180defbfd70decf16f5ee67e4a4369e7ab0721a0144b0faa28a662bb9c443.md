## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}hey there!

I found a problem with the hotspot when users use applications like 
telegram, or using vpn behind the hotspot. if they stay connected and 
download more than the recurring data limit with those apps, it wont 
disconnect them from the hotspot, but after disconnecting, they can't login 
and if the client has used more than 2 days limit, they wont be able to 
login the next day 2.

another situation is that recurring time limits dont work properly. for 
example, if a client uses 1 h of the 2h limit of an account in a day, the 
next day they will only be able to use the rest of their last day limit 
remaining.

is there any fix 2 this? i checked the counters but the syntax seemed 
correct 2 me.

any help would be appreciated.
{% endraw %}
