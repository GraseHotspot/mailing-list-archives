## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thanks for the offers guys. I don't really need any server hosting at this
time as I have a number of VPS's and servers available to me. The reason
for the move was shutting down an older VPS as it's been replaced. However,
I figured at the same time I'd host the demo locally given that we now have
a decent fibre connection, and the server has more grunt than a VPS.

I'm more concerned that I broke something in the move (unlikely as it's in
a docker container) or stuff up a firewall rule.

Regards

Tim
