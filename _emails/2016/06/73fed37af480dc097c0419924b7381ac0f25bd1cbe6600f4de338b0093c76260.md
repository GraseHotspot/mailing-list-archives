## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Tim, I understand what bridging is.
I just thought that bonding may work better here. Bonding (in teaming 
mode, not fail-over mode) would act as old fashioned hub as less 
intelligent then switch.
Of course, I may be wrong.

Personally I would prefer stay with one wired NIC + external switch + as 
many APs as needed (in the future) + spare ethernet ports for wired clients.
