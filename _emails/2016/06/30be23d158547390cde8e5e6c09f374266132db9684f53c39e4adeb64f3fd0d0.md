## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I've tried Grase both 1.5 and 1.6 on both Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 and in all 
cases while surfing through the Hotstop works fine, the upload rate is 
minimal. So low that I cannot send pictures via mail and the upload portion 
of the speed test times out due to it being at zero. There is probably 
something wrong with the way the traffic gets routed outwards. One thing 
that I can't explain is that when I put in the server's dynamic IP in the 
`/etc/hosts` file like so: `10.1.0.2 192.168.13` the upload suddenly starts 
working, but that cannot be the correct solution to the issue.

Having encountered this error last week, I decided to finally put my foot 
down and learn some Linux, and after a week of constant reading, I think I 
have been highly successful at learning the basics of it using the Edx 
course and some tutorials. However, when it comes to networking stuff on 
pages like AboutDebian <http://www.aboutdebian.com/> and in the Linux 
Network Administrators Guide that I found floating freely around the net - 
apart from the basics, I find the material absolutely overwhelming - so 
I've decided to ask again here. I am really not going to be able to solve 
this without somebody more experienced to give me a hand. Sadly, I am not 
actually getting paid to set up these hotspot apart from in food - it is 
too bad I can't donate that via Paypal either.

Could anybody tell me where should I start in resolving this issue? Thanks.

P.S. When I install Ubuntu 14.04 Server, the eth0 and eth1 interfaces have 
the p1p1 and p3p1 names instead. I've barely managed to figure out how to 
set Grase to recognize these new interfaces by modifying the 
`/etc/chilli/config` file. An improved installation for Grase and/or a note 
in the installation documentation about this file should be made.
{% endraw %}
