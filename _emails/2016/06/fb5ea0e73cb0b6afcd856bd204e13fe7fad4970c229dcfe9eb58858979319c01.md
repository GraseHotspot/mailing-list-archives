## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi, I have a PC with dual NICs plus an internal wireless card. Can I 
configure both a wired lan port and the internal wireless card 
simultaneously for LAN access? I can use one or the other selecting through 
the Grase admin interface (p4p1 or wlan0) and both work but cannot figure 
out how to have them both running together. I would like to use internal 
wireless card as an access point indoors and plug in another access point 
that will be mounted outdoors for outdoor coverage. Any help would be 
appreciated.

Regards,
Derek
{% endraw %}
