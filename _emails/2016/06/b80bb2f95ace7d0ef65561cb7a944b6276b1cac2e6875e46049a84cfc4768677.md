## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Christopher

All my changes are in https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-coova-chilli

You can probably just build the upstream package, and it should mostly
work. Most of my changes are packaging changes, and things like setting it
to start at boot by default.
The command 'git diff ac7f791f9f51d8872750cb8c2e8938bf049eb95b' in the
repository will give you everything that I changed since the 1.3.0 release.

Are you able to collect support info as described at
https://grasehotspot.org/support/collecting-support-information/ ?? Do you
have an active IPv6 connection in your network, or is it only Link-Local
addresses?

Tim
