## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Derek

You need to make a bridge between the wireless network interface, and the
wired NIC. You then select this bridge as the Hotspot LAN.
However, on the one device I've tried this on, for some reason Squid
transparent proxying didn't work, so I had to disable the squid transparent
proxy redirect to make it work.
I've recently purchased a new device to test this with, with dual NIC and
internal wireless, so hopefully I can play more with the Squid issues to
work out why it wasn't working.

Regards

Tim
