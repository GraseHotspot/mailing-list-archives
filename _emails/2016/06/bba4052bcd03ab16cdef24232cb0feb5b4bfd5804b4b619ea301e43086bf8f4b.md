## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim and the community, 
I've been using Grase for about 3 years now and it's been working 
perfectly. I have a Grase server which I disabled squid logging all 
together because of low-end hardware but now I'm working on a new server 
and I want to enable squid logging and I want it to log ONLY domain 
look-ups. Is there such an option in squid configuration in the access log? 
Would you give me some pointers on how to optimize squid so that it won't 
use much resource(CPU and RAM) and that it only keep a log of domain 
look-ups?
Thanks

{% endraw %}
