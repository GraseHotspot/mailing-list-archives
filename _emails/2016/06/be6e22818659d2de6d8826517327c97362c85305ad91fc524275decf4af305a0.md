## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}This is interesting to me too. Never heard about "gro".

Now know bit more:

Generic Receive Offload
\u25cf GRO restricts what can be merged:
\u2013Identical MAC header.
\u2013Only certain IP header fields can differ.
\u2013Only certain TCP header fields can differ.
\u25cfMerged packet can be resegmented losslessly.
\u25cfGRO reuses GSO infrastructure.

GRO Status Quo
\u25cfSupported by many (but not all) 10GbE drivers.
\u25cfComplete conversion of remaining drivers.
\u25cfAddress any performance regressions.
\u25cfEventual removal of LRO. (Large Receive Offload)

(source of above abstract: 
https://events.linuxfoundation.org/images/stories/slides/jls09/jls09_xu.pdf 
)


However, I found this related to to 10Gb NICs

What was your NIC Marko?
