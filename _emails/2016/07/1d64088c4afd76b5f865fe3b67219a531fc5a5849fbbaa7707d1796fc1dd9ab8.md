## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim,

The url to the requested information is:

https://paste.grasehotspot.org/view/eca328c6

The interesting thing through all of the existing bugs/errors with
coova-chilli code and the outdated freeradius (Debian still has not
bothered updating to the now stable 3.x series) is that people are still
able to surf the net.

I *only* stumbled upon this error with the mysql table when I noticed that
apache had only been running 1 day and I started to check the email's of
the log files and found it.

This server was setup last week of May this year.

I do apt-get update at least once a week and just before running the
script to collect the support information 31 packages got updated.

I have not done the manual update of coova-chilli as mentioned in my post
about coova-chilli being outdated, as I do not want the server going down
so that people can not login and surf.  I tried to do a custom kernel to
the latest stable branch from kernel.org using the debian tools to create
the image and was unable to surf the internet with it. I had hoped that
debian had solved the issuses with their scripts etc in the years since I
stopped using them.

I let it do a make oldconfig which should have ensured that everything
worked but as stated it didn't ;(.

I also posted about ipv6.  Most isp's here in New Zealand are not offering
ipv6 to residential customers as yet.  The isp we are using, according to
the online tools do not have ipv6 enabled.  I double checked by turning on
ipv6 in the router that they provided and got no ipv6 connection, so
turned it off again.

Sadly the wireless access point that I purchased will need to be replaced
when ipv6 is rolled out here.  Though that is annoying, mostly because I
never thought to check that it did do ipv6, at least I now know that the
netis routers are, up to the task and I will request that the company that
I bought it off here in Nz get the latest when its needed.

We only have 16 users here, but as it is a backpackers there is always a
turnover and despite everything, this is way more stable/reliable than the
pos antamedia and windows 2003 server was.

Regards,

Christopher.
