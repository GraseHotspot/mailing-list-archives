## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Dear All :

we have grase installed in a hospital. on the MRI site they have a computer
and a MRI application which they need to access from outside. They have
asked us to open ports 80,8041,104 so they can access the application via
valid IP over the internet.
we have the IP valid on our server and the MRI computer is in the grase
network.
I tried many ways to open these ports but no success. I used both iptables
commands and a software called rinetd. Can you please tell me why we can
not forward these ports ?

Many Thanks
{% endraw %}
