## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Would like to add my thanks for making this available. I have had an older 
version running on a very old laptop in my local pub for some years now and 
have been wondering if there was a better way.  Well a couple of weeks back 
everything died and so I was forced into action and found this post.It took 
less than an hour to pull the bits together, build and test this version.  
The best bit was, when I got into the office to install it I found the 
laptop was powered off - I turned it on and it was all working fine. Seems 
they had a power cut which had lasted longer than the ancient laptop's 
battery but no-one had actually checked it!
Anyhow, the new system was installed in minutes and they are loving it 
especially the new free access users, they were printing of hundreds of 
tickets per week.
