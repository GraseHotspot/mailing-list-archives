## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}You should be able to port forward with iptables, however you need to
ensure you are using the correct network interface, as it might need to be
on the tun interface. You'll also need to ensure the MRI computer is
authenticated so it can access the internet.

Coova Chilli (the access controller used by Grase) isn't the best at this.
You may want to try Googling "coova chilli port forward" and see if any of
the posts you find help you with that.

Regards

Tim
