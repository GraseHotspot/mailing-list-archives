## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello,

This *may* not be the case for you, but a number of Internet Service
providers are using carrier grade nat.  Mostly this is for residential
customers so it may not be an issue.  With carrier grade nat port
forwarding will not work.

You have not specified if you have a static/fixed ip address from the
internet service provider.  An easy way to know if the isp is using
carrier grade nat is to look for an ip address in the 100.64.0.0/10 range
in your arp cache.

I have no idea if a hospital is classed as a business or not, so it could
either be business or residential internet access.

Regards,

Christopher.
