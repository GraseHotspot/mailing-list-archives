## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Christopher

If the Wireless "Router" is truely just acting as an Access Point, and not
routing, then you can ignore what range it's on and just configure the
Grase Hotspot how you wish. Ideally, you want your management IP's on
Wireless AP's to be on a different network to your clients, so a rogue
client can't easily discover the AP's management to attempt to break in.
If it's a true Access Point, it's IP being on a different network to the
clients and the Grase Hotspot won't stop it working, as all it's doing is
passing Layer 2 traffic around, where IP is Layer 3.

Do you know the model number of the AP?

Also, can you try putting Grase onto something like
192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0 (your WAN is 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 so no
conflict there). I think you'll find it'll just work regardless of your
AP's settings. (Note: you'll probably want to reboot after changing the IP
range, there are some small bugs that a reboot fixes)
