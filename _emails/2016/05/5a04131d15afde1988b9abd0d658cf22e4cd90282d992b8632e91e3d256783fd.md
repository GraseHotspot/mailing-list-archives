## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I'm not sure why, but the range in the database isn't the default one. Have
you since changed it?


   1. #chilli_lanip 10.0.0.2
   2. #chilli_wanif eth0
   3. #chilli_lanif eth1
   4. #chilli_network 10.0.0.0
   5. #chilli_netmask 255.0.0.0


If you changed the netmask to 255.0.0.0, then even with an IP of 10.1.0.1
as the server IP, it would start the DHCP range at 10.0.0.1

A good tool to see ip ranges is sipcalc. You can see that the start of the
range is 10.0.0.1. You also have a stupidly large IP range. You should
reduce your netmask to something reasonable, such as 255.255.255.0, or
255.255.254.0 if you need more than 250 odd clients.
