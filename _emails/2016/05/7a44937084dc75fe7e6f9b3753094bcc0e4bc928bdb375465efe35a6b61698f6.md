Hi Drazen,

 

Rooaming between Routers with different Chilli is not possible. You always 
get a new IP when moving from one chilli to another.

 

I use this configuration with several sites, each site has only one Chilli 
(DD-WRT) runing (I use Netgear WNDR3700V4 And R7000). I use several APs on 
the LAN side, all of them in bridge mode, this way Chilli assigns IPs to 
every client. This configuration allow roaming between APs so you can move 
inside the site without loosing connection.

If you move to another site you will get a different IP and you will need 
to login again.


Regards,
