## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Paul,
In future post things like this to the list. Others may have already
written scripts that can help you.

3 Months is a tricky time frame. Last login details are in the radpostauth
table. That's cleaned up regularly though, at the 2 month mark I think. So
the next place to look is if there are any entries in the mtotacct table
(something like that, I'm not near the code at the moment). It's the table
that we archive (around the 2 month mark) previous sessions into a single
monthly summary.

So if there are no entries in that table for the last 3 months, and no
entires in the radpostauth table for the last 3 months, then they are
inactive.

Also, not sure why you need the radcomment table to get MAC addresses. The
radcheck table should have all enabled users in it.

If you work out the query you need, I can add it to the nightly cron job,
and make it an option to run it from the admin interface. (Although to mail
you you'd need to update the crontab)

Looking forward to seeing how you go.

Tim
