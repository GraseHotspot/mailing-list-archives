## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}This is why I dont allow free access to my AP network...

The Social Login is a mean to obtain social information about the user 
(with their permission) for future marketing... I provide free internet in 
exchange of the social network information (Name, Email, country), so that 
I can later use it to provide segmented marketing.

Currently, my customized Hotspot, provides 4 diferent login types, social 
login is just one of them.

There are hostpot solutions that only work with social login... I wanted to 
provide that option too.
