## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}As already pointed out by others, you can lookup the Google API's being
used, and see that it's not uploading anything to google, but using the
Google charts library locally in your browser to render graphs. Google does
not get any of your private information, it's not stored in any account.

Being open source, you can also see all the code, so feel free to browse it
on Github. The page in question is
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/blob/master/files/usr/share/grase/www/radmin/templates/reports.tpl

If you have a problem with Google libraries, please stop using the Grase
Hotspot, or just stop using the Reports page.

I've never hidden any part of the hotspot system, the code is all public on
Github. I welcome security audits as no one is paying for any, so feel free
to pay for a security audit.
