## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I had opendns once, and it was working fine.
You just need a static IP (at least then, i don't know if now you can do it
with something like no-ip..
There are a lot of site your can deny access from categories they have
(gambling, porn sites).
If you want to block services though, you can't and you probably have to
find another solution.
