## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Just as a follow up, the programmer installed the patch 3 times, each time 
changing the variables uninstalling chill and reinstalling etc. We don't 
know what the problem is but assume it is on our end. 
Each time we install the patch the system crashes and we have to reboot 
etc. The only comment the programmer has is the patch has some dependencies 
that break the system.
So we have nothing specific we can add, however we are open to any 
suggestions.
Thank you.
