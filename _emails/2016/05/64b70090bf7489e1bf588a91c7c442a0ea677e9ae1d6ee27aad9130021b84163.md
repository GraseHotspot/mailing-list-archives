## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi José

Do you find any slowdown of the system doing this? Part of the reason I'd
gone for the ~2 month mark was to ensure that the system was running
quickly as the database tables haven't been optimised for many months of
data.

In general, my response to keeping more data has been to point the user to
the backups. We take a nightly backup of the database, which IMHO means we
don't need to keep the detailed session data in the live database. Also,
what information do you need to keep, as you'll want to ensure the squid
logs are backed up as well then.

What might be useful is for people to fill in details at
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/156 for the
logging/history requirements in their country. Then I can try and
accommodate the different requirements, and provide options to toggle
between storing for X and storing for Y and not storing at all.
