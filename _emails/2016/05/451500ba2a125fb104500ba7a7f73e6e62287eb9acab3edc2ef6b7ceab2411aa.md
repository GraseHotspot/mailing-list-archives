## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Tim,

On the same subject, we had to change the code that did the 2 months 
cleaning up (of sessions/vouchers) due to legal necessities in Europe 
(Portugal), where we have to keep the last 12 months of history in the 
HOTSPOT, maybe it would be nice, to have a parameter in backoffice to say 
"Clean history after (months):"
