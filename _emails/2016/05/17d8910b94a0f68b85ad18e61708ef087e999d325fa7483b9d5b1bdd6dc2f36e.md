## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Ok, I think I didn't get the full  picture, thought the problem applied to
all devices you were using .....but now I think it's device specific.

Ooookkkk... Testing time then...

I did what you mention...

Made chilli *local.conf* with* lease=10* and then tested.

I was given the same IP address even after *chilli_query *stopped listing
me in *chilli_query dhcp-list*

Meaning, that 5 minutes after i had my DCHP release, the IP i was given
again was the same, and i did try to conect another device prior, to see if
i was given the first available ip from the ippool...

So no luck there... No Browser was open again (on second connection to
wifi, which was 5 minutes after i disconected the wireless).

my chilli.conf

interval=60
nousergardendata
defidletimeout=604800
dhcpstart=2
lease=10

output of chilli_query dhcp-list (theres a 60 seconds lease grace period,
that why the 19/10 on bold line).

18-1E-B0-BE-68-2B 10.1.0.6 dnat 1/10
*80-65-6D-2C-BE-49 10.1.0.2 dnat 19/10*
00-90-FB-42-65-4D 10.1.0.5 dnat 9/10

Im tearing my hair out... since i tried with three diferent versions of
android (5, 5.1.1, 4) but only the iphones worked!!! connect /disconnect /
connect / disconnect ... it always shows the UAM on the iphones (i cant
believe i am saying this).
