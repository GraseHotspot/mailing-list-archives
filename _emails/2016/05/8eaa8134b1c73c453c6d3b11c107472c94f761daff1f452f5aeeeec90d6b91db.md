## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I am using open dns, and its been really good, it blocks most of the torrents sites and if you need you can always add web address you would like to ban manually. You need static IP, not sure how it works with dynamic.

Also, if someone is smart, can change dns manually to 8.8.8.8 (google dns) and everything magically back to normal. Or someone can use vpn and can go around opendns.

Best to have router and block services directly on the router itself, but my approach is:

Use Opendns, and if someone actually know how to go around it, its bonus for them and they deserve to go around and use it (but we talk probably 1 of 1000 users will know what is going on)

Hope this helps

Bartosz

Tim

Is there any way we can target and block specific services, like torrents, streaming sites, etc?

Anyone has implemented OpenDNS, if so can you elaborate on the implementation details?

Thanks.
