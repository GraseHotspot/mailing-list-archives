## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I agree with Tim 100%

Assume everyone under "sky cap" has e.g FB account today (what is not 
far from true).
If you allow free access to your AP network it would be the same efect 
as you would do with FB account login. So why bother with social ?

AAA is invented many years ago, somehow we need it still today.
Authentication, Authorization, Accounting , this is exactly what radius 
do. We only need to decide to use it or not. Not using means free.
I don't see sense.
Can you Borges explain us what do you wish to achieve with social login?
Perhaps we don't see your have on your mind.

Rgds.
