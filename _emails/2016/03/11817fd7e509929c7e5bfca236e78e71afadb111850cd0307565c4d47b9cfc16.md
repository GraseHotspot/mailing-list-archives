## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Indeed.

Somehow I missed that.

OK, I'm thinking we could craft a special login page that only need them to
click on OK. Computer/special accounts could have a flag that totally
prevents this process.
Cache all current logged in sessions, de-auth all sessions, set a system
announce flag per session, display this special page as the login page (if
system announce set), onclick OK - unset system announce-reset session from
cache.

Haven't found the time to start trying these things on my on own yet but
maybe soon I can try get environment ready, and acquire the programming
language skills.
