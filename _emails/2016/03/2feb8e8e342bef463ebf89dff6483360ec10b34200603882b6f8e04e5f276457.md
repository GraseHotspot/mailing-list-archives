## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi everyone, hi Tim.

Can anybody help me in modification of the report page, as the picture i've 
attached. I need to add Account comment displayed after the "User" column. 
the previous one, which on the session page, the account comment was added, 
which is great.
I know not everybody need this add on modification, but in my case, i need 
it to ease on monitoring the report.

If someone done it, please share how is the coding was done.

Also, one more great feature i can see on both session page, report page 
and user page is search function. I bet this can help a lot specially when 
we are looking for specific user, where a lot of user are registered in our 
database.

Thank for your hard work Tim. Thanks to  everyone too for sharing many 
possible problem and solution found on Grase Hotspot.

Regards,
Jerren
