## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Add this entry to your 'radreply' table
UserName:CoovaChilli
Attribute: ChilliSpot-Config
op:+=
Value: ethers=/etc/ethers
Then create a file in /etc directory called ethers
I.e
Run this command on your Linux terminal
sudo touch /etc/ethers
Then populate the /etc/ethers file with the IP-MAC mapping in this format
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF 123.123.123.123
On each line with its own entry
In my case I tried adding comments to the file but it ended up messing the
file so I had to remove the comments in the file.
You will have to restart chilli for effects to take place
