## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim, 

I just want to double check here. 

I have a v3.7.7.11 system on Ubuntu 12.04 that I am upgrading to v3.8.0 on Ubuntu 14.04

I wanted to minimise the downtime and since the whole lot is on a VM I have built a brand new Ubuntu14.04 and v3.8.0.
Default install adjacent to the existing one. 

Can I then just replace the database on the new system with the one from the old - or are there db structure changes that need to be applied? 
If so are there scripts I can run that will perform those db updates immediately after replacing the default db with a copy of the old v3.7.7.11 version?
Or will the db updates run on restart? 


Dave

If it requires a new install can you restore database backups from 3.7.7.11 into 3.8.0 RC2? If you can do an in place upgrade what would are the steps to make this go as smoothly as possible.
