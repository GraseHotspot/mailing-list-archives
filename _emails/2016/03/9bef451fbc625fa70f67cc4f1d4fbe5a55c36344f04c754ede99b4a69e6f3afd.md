## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Can we Block and allow the website category based group. 

For Example:

Manager Group : Need to block the adult and social category. If any website 
block by this category, but which is not adult or social. we have to allow 
the website for this group.(not for all).
Online Group : Need to Block the adult category. block the individual 
website.

Please Guide me how to do this...

Advance Thanks
Shakthi
