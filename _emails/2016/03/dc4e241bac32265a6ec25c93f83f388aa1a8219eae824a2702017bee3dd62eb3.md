## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}You need to restart dnsmasq and chilli.  I know its a trouble,  but for now
that's the only way to make it working after reboot after you face this
unable to redirect issue.  Maybe Tim can take a look why was this happen.

So far for me to fix the issue, i've setup cron job 4 minutes after
bootup,  it restart the dnsmasq and chilli.

Maybe Tim can find out the possibilities of this issue appeared.
