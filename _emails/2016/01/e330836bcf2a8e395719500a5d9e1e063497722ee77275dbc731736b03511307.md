## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Actually I did nothing specially with boot partition. I just let ubuntu 
installation to adjust partitions to its default values. I was expected 
that this part of installation is made to adjust partition in best 
practicies manner.
However I found some explanation at ubuntu forum.
It says that because some computers could not boot if boot folder is far 
away from disk start. Far means 100Gb away away or so. That is why 
ubuntu installation will make /boot partition as separate partition 
which is big as 236 Mb (allowed up to 1 Gb but it is not explained when 
it will be set to 1 Gb). Anway this is pretty odd reason and solution. 
Even 1 Gb big boot willl become full soon.
Will keep on investigation on this.
