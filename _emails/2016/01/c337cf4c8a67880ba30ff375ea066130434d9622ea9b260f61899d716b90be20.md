## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}We often get questions to the mailing list that lack information. I've
written a quick tool that will collect the common information we need, and
upload it to a pastebin. Hopefully this will help get all the information
we need for the common support requests.

To use, just run the following 2 commands.

> wget
> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GraseHotspot/support-info/master/collect-support-info.sh
> bash collect-support-info.sh


https://github.com/GraseHotspot/support-info Pull requests welcome if I've
missed anything important. And yes, it does ask you to review the
information before it uploads it.

Tim
