So 3.8 will install on 12.04?  I had the notion in my mind that it would
not.  Good to know.

Taking a database dump (at the database outhouse? :-), is that a Grase
GUI function or do I have to dig down and learn something about how
Grase works?

This time of year (this is a trout fishing resort), the system is pretty
inactive so would I be safe just grabbing the newest /var/backups/grase
files?

That turned my head.  I've been running the GUI all this time with
12.04.  Is there something to trip me up in 14.04?  I would otherwise be
running the Gnome retro desktop.

Thanks.  It may be a couple of weeks before I give it a shot.  Trying to
get product out the door right now.
