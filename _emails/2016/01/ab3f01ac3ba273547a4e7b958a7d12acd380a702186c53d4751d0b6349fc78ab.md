{% raw  %}Hi Tim

Collected support information can be found in:

https://paste.grasehotspot.org/view/ec837c45

Using wlan0 as the Hotspot using hostapd. 
Broadcast working ok
DHCP lease, working ok
DNS, pointing to wlan0 address ok

I'd like very much to provide the linux client that you sugested, how can I 
do that? 
Ethernet connected to a box that also has wireless with teamviewer and give 
you the client and pass? Please point me in that directions. 

Regards
