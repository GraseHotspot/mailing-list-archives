## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Ok, I've cleaned already many things in boot and with kernels. Boot 
dropped to 45%, 120Mb available.
After what I was able to make latest update and upgrade. I am at v3.8.0

I would like one instance of grase to move away from nightly build
Now I am interested how to switch from nightly to stable update grase 
version?
What would be the correct line in 
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/grasehotspot.list ?
What else?
