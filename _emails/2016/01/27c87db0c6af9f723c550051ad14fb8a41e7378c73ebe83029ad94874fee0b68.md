{% raw  %}Hi John

In theory, you can just do an Ubuntu upgrade to 14.04, then follow the
install steps for the latest stable version, which should reinstall
anything that is removed during the upgrade. The database should remain
intact.

However, a new install is a great idea as well. What version of Grase do
you currently have installed?
I would personally go a 2 step approach.
First, upgrade the Grase install to the latest, this will ensure all
database upgrades are run. Then take a database dump (both the radius and
radmin databases). Obviously checking that these dumps are correct is
critical. There is a daily backup in /var/backups/grase, so maybe take a
copy from there as well.
Then install your new server, and setup Grase. Lastly, restore the database
dumps to the new server.

This will get you a new clean server, with no cruft, and your users
database. If you can, please avoid desktop installs of Ubuntu, and go for
server installs.

Looking forward to hearing how things go. Give a shout if you need more
help.

Regards

Tim
