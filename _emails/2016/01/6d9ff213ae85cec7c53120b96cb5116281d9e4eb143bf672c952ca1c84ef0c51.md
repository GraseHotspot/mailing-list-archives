## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}HI Antonio

Can you please gather some support data (
https://grasehotspot.org/support/collecting-support-information/)
Can you also please check that your are getting DHCP leases on your
clients, and that the DNS points to the Hotspot server?

Do you have any Linux clients we can run some tests with?

Regards

Tim
