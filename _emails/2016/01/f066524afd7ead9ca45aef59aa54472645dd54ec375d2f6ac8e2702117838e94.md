It should work. I have done tests to make sure, but my testing has been
focused on 14.04 and Debian 7/8.

If you aren't worried about "todays" data, just grab the /var/backups/grase
file. Probably still a good idea to check the data is valid. A database
dump is a mysqldump command to export the entire database, structure and
data. There are 2 databases, radius and radmin.

I tell people to avoid the Gui, as that avoids Network Manager being
installed, which causes the most issues. If you need the GUI, that's fine,
there are just some extra steps for Network Manager in the install the
verify.
