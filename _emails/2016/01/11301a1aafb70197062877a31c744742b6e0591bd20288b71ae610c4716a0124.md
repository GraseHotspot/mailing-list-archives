## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}How did you manage to create a user without a username? Both the HTML form,
and the PHP enforce a username.
If you use your browser to inspect the row, can you see the edit link for
that user? Maybe it's a character that is invisible, but in the url it'll
be urlencoded.

Otherwise you'll have to resort to SQL.

Regards

Tim
