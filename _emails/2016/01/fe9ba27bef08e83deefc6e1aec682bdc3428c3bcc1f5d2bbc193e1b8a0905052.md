## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}It's probably a good thing for Guests to have to start their own session.
Ideally they'd have their own login details, so you can track who accesses
what.
If it's actually a guest computer, that should always have guest access,
then maybe a computer account?

Most hotels etc just give the guest a login, and they can use it on their
computer, or the hotel kiosk computers, until the time runs out. I don't
think it's a bad thing for sessions to idle out.

You may need to increase the DHCP timeout as well, as it might be the DHCP
lease is released causing the session to end. A computer that is off should
not continue to have a session. An idle computer can still continue to have
a session as long as it's on and maintains a network connection.

Regards
