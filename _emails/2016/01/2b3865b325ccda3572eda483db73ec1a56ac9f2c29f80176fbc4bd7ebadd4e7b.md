## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hey guys and Tim in particular.

I've been hugely busy starting a new induction heater company (Fluxeon
split) and related things and have kinda lost track of where things are now.

My Grase machine is a 12.04LTS desktop machine that really isn't used
for anything else right now.

I would like to bring everything current.  I'm thinking 14.04LTS and
Grase 3.8.0?

This machine has been upgraded since Ubuntu 6 or thereabouts so there is
a lot of cruft on it.  I'm thinking that a clean install would be
appropriate.

I'm an EE and embedded system programmer.  I know Linux fairly well but
know nothing about SQL or how routing works.

So my question is: What do I need to do to upgrade?  What do I need to
backup?  I have a couple hundred seasonal users so I don't want to lose
the user databases.

Thanks,
John
