## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}It sounds like you've made your boot partition too small. You probably want
to check if you have older kernels installed that you don't need, and
uninstall them (make sure you leave the current kernel  that you are
running). That should hopefully free up enough space to install the latest
kernel as well.

Upgrades shouldn't lose data. There are daily database backups in
/var/backups/grase/
