## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}At first glace things look right. It's probably an issue with how you've
connected your "router" on the LAN side. If it's just doing wireless (which
is should be), then you'll probably want to plug the LAN side of the server
into a LAN port on the router. Ensure that DHCP server is off on the
router, and you should get access.

Check what IP address your clients get, it it's not in the 10.1.0.0/24
range, something isn't right.
