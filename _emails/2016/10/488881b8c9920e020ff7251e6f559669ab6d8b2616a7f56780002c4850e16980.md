## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Common problem i faced when i do system reboot when its on busy traffic.

To fix this, i usually go to cli then use superuser. After that, restart
chilli and dnsmasq few times. If problem persist, i do reload chilli and
dnsmasq then restart chilli & dnsmasq.

Btw, Grase server on my side transfer high bandwidth data averaging at
450GB a day.

Just as update. Reinstalled GRASE 3.8.0 (with all same settings) and users
immediately on and using at full speed. No idea what is wrong.
