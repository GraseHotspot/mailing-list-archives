{% raw  %}Hi Glyn

Is it possible that there is something about the Pi architecture (it is ARM
not X86) that causes the issues? Its hard to know where to even look for
the performance issues given that I don't have a Pi to work with, or lots
of devices. I also expect that your testing of high bandwidth applications
is probably the wrong test. Lots of users who are browsing == lots of small
connections, not high bandwidth. I'm wondering if we are hitting some limit
with the number of connections. A good way to test would be firstly to take
Coova Chilli out of the equation, just have the Pi do normal NAT. That
would show if it's the extra CPU/IO of Coova chilli that's at fault. (Yes,
this would require no captive portal for awhile, but that would be a good
test).

If you are happy to give me remote access (grase-conf-openvpn +
grase-remote-assist-user) and let me know the peak times (and timezone) I
can try and do some more monitoring to try work out what's happening.
Probably even setup Zabbix to monitor different aspects of the system to
see any correlation between the slowdown and other monitored items.

I've not got heaps of time, and I understand you also don't have heaps of
time to debug it, but if you're willing to give it another shot, lets see
if we can work out the issue.

Regards

Tim
