## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Gianluca

I'm wondering why you are wanting to do this, considering it's done for you
automatically already. Expired users are currently deleted 2 months after
they expire. At the end of each month, the previous months traffic logs are
"bundled up" into a single monthly total, and added to the motacct table.
This is a very compact format so I wouldn't concern myself with deleting
data out of that table.

It is possible to modify the current cleanup process to delete when they
have been expired for only 1 month.
You'll want to look at
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/blob/master/files/usr/share/grase/www/radmin/classes/CronFunctions.class.php#L168
to see where we do the deletions. If it's not working for you, check that
the cronjob is running daily.

Regards

Tim
