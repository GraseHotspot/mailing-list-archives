## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thank you for the info. just as a note we would never take part in anything 
that had been hacked.
We installed the hotspot and created the users; about 150. The program 
assigned the numbers, it was very convenient. We'll just create them 
manually, our users sometimes have problems with the password so to double 
that would cause more grief for us. Operator head-space is the number one 
problem with hotspot logons.
Appreciate the info.
