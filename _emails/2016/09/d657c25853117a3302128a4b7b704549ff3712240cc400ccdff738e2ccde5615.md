## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I'm not sure how you had it crate Room1, Room2 etc before. To the best of
my memory, batch users (
https://demo.grasehotspot.org/grase/radmin/newtickets) has always generated
random usernames and passwords.
>From memory, years ago someone on the list might have done a CSV hack.
There is still an open ticket for that to be implemented properly (
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/113).

Regards

Tim
