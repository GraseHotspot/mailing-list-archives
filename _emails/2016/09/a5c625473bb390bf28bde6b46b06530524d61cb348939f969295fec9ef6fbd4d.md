## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi All,

I am in the process of trying to rebuild our Grase environment on XenServer 
7 instead of ESXi and I'm running into some strange issues. Our production 
server is still running - this is just a replacement.

As a comparison, I installed the nightly build on Ubuntu Server 14.04-5 x64 
on both our XenServer host and our ESXi Host exactly the same way, and ESXI 
worked fine (using E1000 NICs) and Xen didn't.

Our production server and the two new ones for testing are all on 
v3.8.0.36.g011c749.

Basically its all about the clients not being able to resolve DNS - they 
get DHCP but can't look anything up. The Grase server itself is able to 
look up DNS just fine. I'm using 208.67.222.123 and 208.67.220.123 on both 
the server itself and configured in Grase for clients to use (they get the 
server's IP 172.16.0.1).

I thought there could be something up with coova-chilli (production was 
running 1.3.0-20-gdd7aa89, the new server was running 1.3.0-22-g39df09b), 
but after I installed fresh on ESXi, it worked with the new version.

The virtual network card that Xen uses is a paravirtualized one, however it 
works fine in Ubuntu itself and on the Windows VMs I've used. The 
description is just "Ethernet" - so not sure if one of the Grase 
dependencies isn't picking it up or binding to it correctly (DHCP for 
clients works though and I can lookup DNS via 127.0.0.1:53 on the server 
via SSH).

Has anyone else had any luck running Grase on XenServer 7? I remember last 
year or earlier when we were discussing getting Grase working on VMWare 
ESXi that a few people said they got it working on Xen, however maybe this 
was XenServer 6.5 instead of 7 (and the licensed version).

I'll rebuild the VM and collect support details.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

Michael
