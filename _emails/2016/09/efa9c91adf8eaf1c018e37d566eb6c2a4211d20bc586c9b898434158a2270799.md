{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

nslookup does work intermittently with the trailing dot at the end.

I am using the same client for testing against the production one and this 
test one - it's a vanilla Windows 7 Enterprise X64 SP1 build + Chrome. If I 
change the VLAN of the test machine to our production guest network, then 
it all works straight away.

Chrome seems to even be having difficulty with some DNS resolution 
(spinning on resolving host) - tried going to disney.com - Chrome timed 
out, and eventually a log entry appeared for www.disney.com but well after 
the timeout (the query/forwarded and reply all came back at the same time).

Checking resources on the server - hardly hitting 2% so I can't see a 
bottleneck there (4x vCPU, 4GB memory)

After a number of attempts, it eventually redirected to the Hotspot portal, 
and then Chrome hung when clicking Free. The entry in grase was still in 
DNAT. In IE it eventually hit the Hotspot portal too. Both timed out when 
loading http://172.16.0.1/grase/uam/hotspot when clicking Free Access. In 
IE I even reached the "Server Timed Out. Please try again" message. The 
second time brought up the "No response from TOS server" message.

Thanks for your help!
