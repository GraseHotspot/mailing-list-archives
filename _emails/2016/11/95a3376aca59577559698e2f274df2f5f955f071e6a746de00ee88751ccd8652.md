## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I assumed when I made the Gitlab project public, that the builds would be
public. Fixed now.
If you head to https://gitlab.com/grase/coova-chilli/builds you can see the
automated builds. Only AMD64 builds are working at the moment. If you then
go into the trusty-amd64 build that completed, you can download the build
artifacts which includes a .deb file you can manually install.

Please note, that these packages have had no testing. I'll do manual
testing of packages once I get i386 builds working, and once I've done
basic testing of packages I'll put them in the nightly repo.

Regards

Tim
