## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}https://grasehotspot.org/donations/

In simple terms. Paypal (you can send it to this email address, the one on
the website is so spammers end up in a different inbox, but same paypal
account). Clicking the button takes fee's, using Paypal's send money to
email address takes no fee's.

If you mean real physical cold hard cash, you'll need to make a trip to
Brisbane, QLD :-P

Also, if you let me know how you want your donation attributed (
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/blob/master/debian/CONTRIBUTORS)
then I'll add you to the list.

I'm not familiar with Filemaker, but my quick google suggests it's a
Mac/Windows thing only.

Regards

Tim
