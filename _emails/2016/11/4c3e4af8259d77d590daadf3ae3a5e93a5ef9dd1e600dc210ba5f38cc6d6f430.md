## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Well... That does seem uncannily familiar. I happen to live in the U.S.A. 
on the west coast. Northern California to be exact. Perhaps the people in 
Australia are just being more proactive about online documentation of the 
problem. Not sure, but it does seem that W10 is usually the culprit and I 
haven't noted that W7 or W8/8.1 do the same. Apple Updates as well, I 
believe the apple products were either El Capitan or Sierra as well.
Thanks again for taking the time to address my concerns. 

Cheers!
