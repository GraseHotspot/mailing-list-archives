## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Firstly, thank you for Grase Hotspot. I have replaced Antamedia with it and 
it has performed exceptionally well except for this one hopefully minor 
issue.
I am producing batches of User Names with Passwords, exporting by CSV and 
creating login cards for a Holiday Park. Some of these combinations do not 
work as an example from the last batch:

kornic    9900        Free
*ruwgez    972        Free*
liplb    6773        Free
*kakw    387        Free*
takbid    7722        Free

It seems that the combinations where the password (numerical) is 3 or less 
are the ones that don't work. I have tried to edit these user names via the 
admin menu by reentering the password number and also by changing the 
number to 4 digits without success. Each batch of 100 user/serial numbers 
creates about 7 combinations that don't work.
Can anyone shed some light on this issue.
Thank you
Paul
