## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi,

 

Here are some suggestions :

 

1.       Operator User :

 

Get operator user that we can choose what they can modify like we create
operator that can only create user without modifiying anything else. Would
be nice to have checkbox and check what they can do like modify speed limit
by user or allow voucher or only allow user based account. If they cant do
something we hide it.

 

2.       Custom Speed Limit by Group and User

 

Allow to choose speed limit by preset or CUSTOM speed

 

3.       Portal Customisation

 

Allow easy way to edit portal webpage for new user that know nothing on web
page editing J Like Chilliwave do with their easy edit method.

 

4.       Backup/Restore System

 

Create easy way to backup settings and backup user/password and to restore
them so if we get hardware failure we will not cry to recreate all users.

 

5.       Creation of Expired Group

 

Every users that is expired for any reason will go on this group. I give you
example of the utility of this group. Imagine grase hotspot used in hotel
you create the user based account in the group 2 days because the customer
stay 2 days in the hotel when expired it goes in group expired.  If the same
customer come back 1 month later we only need to move the customer back in
the 2 days group and his account work fast without any configuration.

 

6.       Change Simultanous Users YES-NO to Number

 

So change the Yes-No choice to 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10.  Why ? Because
imagine an hotspot used in a camping we create an account for a family but
we dont want all the camping use the same login password so we ask them
number of device they own and we set the simul to this number. 

 

 

 

As they are suggestion maybe some feature would be more hard to do so feel
free what you think about them.

 

Also if someone else have suggestion too just answer this messages and add
them J It will be more easy for Tim if we put all our suggestion at the same
place.

 

 

Sorry again for my bad english J

 

Thanks

 

Dave
