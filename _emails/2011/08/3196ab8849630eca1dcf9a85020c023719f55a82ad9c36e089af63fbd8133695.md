## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}In theory, yes, you can do WPA-EAP.
In practice, not so easy. Making the status page available is easy (just 
give the users a special url that will redirect to the status page).
I currently don't have any hardware that supports WPA-EAP, so can't set 
it up to work out what settings are needed in Coova Chilli.
Reading around suggests that it's easy. And this page 
http://coova.org/CoovaChilli/WPACaptivePortal also has information of 
what is needed to allow guests to get a normal UAM login page, while 
successful WPA logins will get direct access.

What particular issues do you have with war drivers? I'm assuming it's 
the fact that all traffic is unencrypted so war drivers could sniff 
details? I'd advertise the hotspot with a WPA2 key, so it's not as easy 
for people to just find the hotspot and connect, but at least the casual 
war driver isn't going to be sniffing it.
