## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello everyone.
I'm back, sorry for the delays while I was away.
I finished the code for preventing simultaneous logins (based on
group) and for limiting up and down bandwidth. I've not been able to
test ether of these features just yet due to limitations in testing
equipment at the moment. If anyone is able to assist with testing
these before I push the update out to everyone, please email me. I
will probably just post a link to the deb file which can be manually
installed, and if no problems are found I'll add it to the repository
for automatic updates.

Thanks for the patience.

Tim
