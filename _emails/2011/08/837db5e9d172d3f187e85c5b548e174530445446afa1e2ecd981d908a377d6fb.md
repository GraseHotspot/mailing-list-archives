## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hi Steffen.

The wlan Access points need to ensure that they don't handle DHCP, and 
instead allow the grase server to handle DHCP. Ideally the best devices 
for doing this are those that are pure wireless access points (without 
any routing stuff). The following link gives basic instructions for 
setting up the dd-wrt as a basic wireless access point. 
http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wireless_Access_Point

I would try setting the wireless access points ip address outside of the 
10.1.0.1 network, and use the LAN port to connect to the grase server. 
(I don't have a dd-wrt, I'm going by what I read in the link and my 
understanding of how it's working). That way, your access points admin 
stuff won't be accessible to people what are using the access point 
(unless they know it's a dd-wrt and can guess that subnet you have it 
running on) as they'll be in the subnet that grase is using, and not the 
subnet that the access point is using. Obviously some testing will be 
needed to see if this will work.

If you'll never have more than a few computers using the hotspot, then 
I'd use 10.1.0.251-253 which shouldn't cause any problems as ip 
addresses are handed out starting at 10.1.0.2. I'll look at reserving 
about 10 addresses for people to set static devices to.

Hope that makes some sense.

Tim
