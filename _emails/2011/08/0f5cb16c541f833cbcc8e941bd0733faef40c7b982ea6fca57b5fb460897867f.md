I've just tested with the next version I'm releasing (3.4) which I'll
post links to the list for testing soon. It appears to work for me
with limit set to 0. I've had to make some fixes so it detects that 0
is a valid number (and not "false"). I couldn't see anything that had
changed betweeen 3.2 and 3.3 that should have caused problems, as most
of the changes were in the freeradius stuff. I've done some basic
testing and setting it to 0 does lock me out.

My guess is that it's a DNS problem. Maybe you have IPv6 available but
not working properly? Just check to see if the gateway machine has
IPv6 available, and if so, if it's working when the problems occur.
Having said that, Google won't serve IPv6 address by default to
prevent this very problem (and instead most peoples IPv6 tunnel
provider will have it setup so you can do IPv6 google).
In the next release or one shortly after, I'm going to be making
dnsmasq a requirement again, as we seem to have the odd DNS issue that
will be nicely solved by dnsmasq. Maybe that'll fix it for you.
