{% raw  %}Hi David

I only just saw this email as it was in my spam.

I currently only have limited apple hardware to test the hotspot on,
so any testing is appreciated.
I do know that an earlier version had a problem if had successfully
logged in, then logged out and was trying to login again. However that
was hopefully fixed when the login page was rewritten.
Are you able to monitor the freeradius server to see if the
authentication is actually failing, or if it's something to do with
the redirects on the safari browser?

So far, it's been the iOS apple devices causing the most problems with
the hotspot unfortunately, but I will work with people to get it
fixed. I have an older ipod touch that I'll try to see if I can
recreate the problem.

Thanks

Tim
