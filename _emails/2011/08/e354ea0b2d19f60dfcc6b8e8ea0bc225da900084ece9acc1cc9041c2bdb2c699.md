## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi, Peace
I am feeling I am sending a lot of emails, Sorry
about grase-hotspot

the policy about Super Admin and Admins
it will be very nice to limit normal admins,
like want to say..

Super Admin will have full access, but Admin users would not to be able 
see or access the "Settings" and Admin Users

This is an Idea, because giving access to normal people for creating 
acc. can mess the things up.

Thank you again,
