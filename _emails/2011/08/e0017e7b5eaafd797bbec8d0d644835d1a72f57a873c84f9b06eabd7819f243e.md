## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Here are some suggestion that i have in mind J

 

1.       Get operator user that we can choose what they can modify like we
create operator that can only create user without modifiying anything else.
Would be nice to have checkbox and check what they can do like modify speed
limit by user or allow voucher or only allow user based account. If they
cant do something we hide it.

2.       Add custom speed limit by group actually we have preset speed J 

3.       Add custom speed limit by user

4.       Allow easy portal webpage customisation J Dunno if we can use
something like in chilliwave to modify webpage easily for noob user J

 

As they are suggestion maybe some feature would be more hard to do so feel
free what you think about them.

 

Thanks

 

Dave
