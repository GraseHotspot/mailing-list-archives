## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Dave.

The OpenVPN package isn't required to have the hotspot working.
Everything should work even without that package.
All the VPN package does is create a VPN connection back to the
central server for support purposes and remote access. Initially I was
only going to allow paying (support subscription) organisations to
install that package, but I don't mind doing basic remote assistance
for people helping test the hotspot, so have opted to have everyone
install the package (which also makes it much easier when someone does
need support, as the package is already there).

It would appear that for some reason between creating the key signing
request, and having it signed, the key has changed. I've deleted the
certificate off the main server, so if you now uninstall the openvpn
package, and delete the contents of the /etc/grase/pki/keys directory,
you should be able to reinstall it. It will appear to fail as it won't
be able to start the VPN connection, but that's just because it's
waiting on the key signing to occur on my side, which happens (when
I'm around) every morning here.

I hope that makes sense.

Tim
