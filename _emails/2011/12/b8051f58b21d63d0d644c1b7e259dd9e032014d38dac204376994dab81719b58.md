If the ipad has had a session through the hotspot (so you've logged in 
to the internet), then in the session logs, if you click on it's ip 
address in there, it will give you the mac address. There is currently 
no easy way if it hasn't had a session. It's probably a good idea to 
open a feature request for "showing all active dhcp clients" so you can 
easily add the machine that way.

Because the admin accounts are tied to anything like an email address, 
there is no easy way to make a password reset that only the admin can 
use. If there are multiple admins, another admin can just delete and 
recreate the other admins account. If all admins have forgotten their 
password then you'll need to edit the mysql database to reset the passwords.

In the network settings, it has a netmask field. Just increase the size 
of the netmask to get more than ~250 ips. However, you probably want to 
do some reading about netmasks and networks before you increase it 
really large. You are better running multiple servers depending on how 
powerful a server you are running. Grase can handle many users, but can 
your hardware?
On a city wide scale, how are all the wireless access points connecting 
back to grase? It may be better to have a number of smaller "hotspot 
zones" that all use the 1 grase server, but each handles it's own 
traffic. (Install grase on each machine, but change the mysql and 
freeradius settings to point to a master server. Currently not easy to 
setup if you don't understand the basics of how grase work, but should 
be fairly simple.
