Hi Tim!Firstly I want to say you Thanks!!!My problem was in the 'radius' user of MySql. As I told you I followed all the steps from your instructions but I tried to install freeradius previously and It created an user called radius with another password. Afterthat I uninstall freeradius but I didn't delete the user. Then I install grase hotspot but I had the user radius with other pass.I'm sorry for the inconvenience!
Thanks from Spain.
Regards
Oscar 		 	   		  {% endraw %}
