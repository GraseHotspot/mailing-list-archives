I've not made any public changes recently, so if it did an update it 
could be a normal security update. When you say dhcp, do you mean the 
dhcp3 client that is installed in Ubuntu, or a dhcp server? The only 
"dhcp" server that should be running is dnsmasq, which from your picture 
below does appear to be running.

The first thing to check is the internet access on the Grase Hotspot 
server. Looking at the screenshot you have taken, it doesn't appear to 
be able to even get a connection to the internet. The VPN not working is 
nothing to worry about as it doesn't rely on the vpn to operate. 
However, as you can see in your screenshot, the gateway is reachable, 
but the internet is not (Internet (Google SA) and Internet (Google All))

What ip address are clients getting? If they can ping 10.1.0.1, there is 
no reason they shouldn't be able to get the "It works" page.

Also, that server monitor page is a little outdated as the note at the 
top says, what does the /grase/radmin/ status page (first one when you 
login) show?
