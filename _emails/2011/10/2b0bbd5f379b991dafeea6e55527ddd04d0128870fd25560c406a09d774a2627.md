## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}It's interesting that you say all you need is ip, time and url. For 
example, if someone downloads a torrent file (which is the most common 
way of downloading movies atm), and then actually downloads the movie 
via bittorrent while on your connect, you won't have anything in your 
logs to show. All the torrent traffic is on ports other than 80, and 
don't involve a url at all. (And lots of torrents are now trackerless, 
so no url's from the tracker connection ether).

Ether way, look at setting up a cron job to copy the squid logs once a 
month and you should have plenty of ips, times and urls from that! If 
you go through the database backups too, you'll even be able to match 
the ip to a mac address.
