## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hey everyone!

Amazing job you guys are doing with translations. Can I ask one favor 
though, please select the language without locale in transifex for new 
translations, unless you are submitting multiple translations for 
different locales.

i.e. For Afrikaans we select 'af' instead of 'af_ZA' unless we are 
submitting multiple Afrikaans translations.

Currently, the way the code is written, we select language based on the 
base language, and the locale stuff happens separately. (So you 
shouldn't have any locale dependent stuff in the translations). If we 
hit a language (and maybe Dutch or Spanish will cause this problem) 
where we need a different translation depending on country (remember 
that currency is handled by a different system to the translations), 
then I'll have to review how we do it then.

I really am amazed at how many translations have been done. This is awesome!

Thanks again to the translators. I'll push the next minor version 
probably today with all the new translations. And thanks to Transifex, 
it's really easy for me to add new translations to packages as well!

Tim
