## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Having not had reliable test equipment for a few months, I discovered a 
number of "bites".
I've pushed some updates both to the portal interface and to 
coova-chilli that will enable some features that should already have 
been enabled.

Firstly, coova-chilli now responds correctly to the settings that are 
changed in the web interface! This change should have been active a few 
versions ago but somehow the changes didn't get commit from my test 
hardware to the package.

The database upgrade to the new templates should actually function now 
(another file missing from a package) in the grase-www-portal package.

Hopefully this will fix idle timeout problems that people have been 
experiencing however I'll do more testing.

And the good news, I have a new test machine to run the hotspot, that 
seems to work reliably, and I have some apple hardware I've been given 
for another project so I can start to work out the iPhone/iPad problems 
people have been having!

Tim
