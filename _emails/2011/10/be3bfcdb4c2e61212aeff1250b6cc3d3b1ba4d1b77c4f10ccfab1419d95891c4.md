## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello All,

I have the same issue here but ("dpkg -l grase-www-portal") reveal that
i have 3.6.2 running, apart from the 3.6.1 error; every thing seams right.

and i have completed two translation "fr" and "it" (soon i will upload the remaining translation "af_za", "ar", "nl_BE," and "es_VE")


Best regards

Hey everyone.

I realise why some of you think you haven't updated. The version number
in the interface didn't get bumped! Sorry.
The version number in dpkg will be correct ("dpkg -l grase-www-portal")
but the version number in the admin interface will still show 3.6.1.

Sorry

Tim
