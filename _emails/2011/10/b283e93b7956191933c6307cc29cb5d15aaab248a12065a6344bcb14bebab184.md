## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I've just released version 3.6, this release is just focussed on network 
settings. You can now change the server lan ip address, and network, as 
well as set your own DNS servers (or use OpenDNS with Family Shield).
Please take note, that for these changes we now have dnsmasq installed, 
which all the clients will use as the DNS server, and dnsmasq will do 
the queries to the servers you set. It WILL NOT use the dns servers from 
DHCP or /etc/resolv.conf, you will need to set the dns servers manually 
or it will default to OpenDNS Family Shield.

As part of this update, the coova-chilli package has been update, as 
have the grase-conf-squid3, grase-conf-freeradius, and we have a new 
package called grase-conf-dnsmasq that does the network settings for 
coova chilli and dnsmasq.

Please let me know how things go. For anyone who has manually modified 
the coova chilli files (/etc/chilli/config) this will again overwrite 
your changes, but that's ok as now you can make all the changes in the 
admin interface and they won't be overwritten again! If there are any 
network settings you need in /etc/chilli/config that aren't currently 
available, just let me know and I'll add them.

Standard upgrade is "sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade"

Translators, please get the new grase.pot file to update your 
translations, lots of new strings.

Thanks

Tim
