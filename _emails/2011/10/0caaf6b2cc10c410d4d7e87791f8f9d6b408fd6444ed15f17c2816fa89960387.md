{% raw  %}Rebecca,

Can you show me that Lusca can cache better than Squid3? I can't find 
much about it. From what I could see, Squid3 should be able to cache 
things like video as well as Lusca.
To use Lusca, you just need to stop Squid before starting Lusca. I'm a 
little hesitant to add support for Lusca atm, given that it's a Squid2 
fork, and currently not in any of the Ubuntu repositories. (We are 
actually using some Squid3 features not found in Squid2).

Tim
p.s. Testing is always good. As you may have seen my earlier email, I 
investigated Drizzle, and alternative SQL server forked off MySQL, in 
particular I was looking at memory usage and discovered for Grase the 
MySQL seems to be using 1/2 the memory of Drizzle, so a change wouldn't 
actually be better!
