## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hi

1) Ticket size display:

The mini screen, which pops up after customer login, displays the remaining bandwidth balance as at the first of the month instead of the total issued, while the status page, after logging in to the client zone, shows the correct total...
This confuses my users (although that's not hard to do, lol), but is there a way to consistently show the total issued on the mini screen?

2) 5 Gb ticket display problem:
All 5 Gb tickets are shown as being 4 Gb in size on the mini screen.
Any ideas?

3) 5 Gb ticket limit problem:
I have found a weird problem which only seems to have affected one customer (with a 5 Gb ticket) so far.
As soon as his ticket reached 4 Gb it terminated his session and presented him with the "you have reached your b/w limit" message.

Some time later (days or weeks, I don't know, but definitely within the same month) it allowed him to continue.
He had a second 5 Gb ticket which did the exact same thing.
I only have one other customer who has exceeded 4 Gb of his 5 Gb ticket and he had no such problem!
Any ideas?

4) Host resources:
I have Grase sitting in a VirtualBox VM.
Grase has a WAN IP of 192.168.1.3, the machine hosting the VM has an IP of 192.168.1.2 and the ADSL router is ... wait for it ... 192.168.1.1
I have several web apps (Apache-MySQL-PHP) sitting on 1.2 (the host), but in order to access them via the network I have to perform a Grase login first.
This is not the behavior I am looking for.
I need the host web server to be fully accessible to the network, without radius login.
I have just added 192.168.1.2 to "walled garden allowed hosts" on the radmin page - is this all I need to do?

Regards,
Tim S{% endraw %}
