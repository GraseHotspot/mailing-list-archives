{% raw  %}Hi Rebecca.

Anything that Lusca does to save bandwidth, squid3 should also be doing 
(unless there was something I missed on the Lusca site about video 
caching?).
It should be possible to use Lusca instead of squid3, however it would 
need to waiting until there is an Ubuntu package for it, and if there 
was demand then I could make it use Lusca as an alternative proxy. I do 
want to be able to support other proxies, but currently am only 
supporting squid3.

What in particular about Lusca makes you want to use it?

Tim
p.s. You /could/ install Lusca, override squid3 so it doesn't load, and 
make sure Lusca loads on the same port as squid3, and logs to the same 
files.
