{% raw  %}#34: Make status more understandable
----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------

 Priority:  major           |   Milestone:  4.0
Component:  Splash Screens  |     Version:  3.4

 Current status page was designed for when you just had a timelimit and/or
 a data limit.
 Need to change it to give better feed back of your "plan" (group) and that
 the things like session-timeout aren't necessarily the plan limits.
 I.e. someone on a data limit plan will have a session timeout of many
 hours, which is actually how long until the account expires. We should
 probably hide session timeout in this case.
 Someone with a recurring data/time limit needs to know that the session
 limits are for a time period, not the account limit.
 Also need to see hard limits, i.e. if they have a recurring limit, as well
 as a hard limit, they need to know both limits.

 Maybe show them bandwidth limits as well?
