{% raw  %}Hi all

As you can see Linux is not my native environment so please forgive ignorance of such things:)

After spending some time playing with Easyhotspot and getting almost to a proof of concept readiness, but bothered by the fact the project is quite buggy and unlikely to be developed further, I heard about GRASE and decided to move over to this product.

I have completed a happy error free installation, with everything default except setting a SQL / Radius password rather than letting it create a random one and everything looks fine. But now I am stuck:

IFCONFIG reveals that eth0 is fine on my home network and browsing to its address gets me to the 'It works' page.  ETH1 shows nothing, which I expect is correct and TUN0 has 10.1.0.1 /24, but there it stops.  I have that network into a simple switch / hub connected to the wifi AP and a management laptop.  Both were set for DHCP but seem not to get an address (as happened with Easyhotspot) and when I set the laptop to 10.1.0.254 /24 to test I am unable to browse to http://10.1.0.1/grase/radmin with a connection time out.

So: some specific questions:
Have I done something obviously wrong
Is there  an archive of this mail list so I can study previous issues q&a etc.
Is there a FAQ?
How might a simpleton like me install a GUI on top of the server which I can fire up to understand more of the system.

My test environment details.
Home LAN with DHCP, local DNS with forwarding, default gateway is MS ISA server as firewall / proxy
Grase box: Compaq M700 laptop with D-Link PCMCIA card for ETH1
Currently wifi AP set to get dhcp address, but once I can connect to the management page I will be able to address that if necessary

Any help much appreciated.

regards
