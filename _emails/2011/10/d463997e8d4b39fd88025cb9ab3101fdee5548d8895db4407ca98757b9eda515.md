Hi Marty,

What in particular do you want to log? By default, all traffic on port 
80 goes through the Squid proxy, which keeps logs for about 1 month. 
(Check in /etc/logrotate.d/squid3 i think for exact details). So this is 
all normal un-encrypted web traffic. (And it logs the url's, not the 
entire contents). The session logs are currently kept for a month (so 
mac address, ip address, access times and data used) although because it 
does automatic backups nightly, when the logs are cleared from sql at 
the start of the next month, you can extract them from the backup files 
easily.

Given my original location I wrote the hotspot for, I assume it's legal 
for hotspot operators to log identifying data. If there is anyone in a 
country that needs the hotspot to not log any identifying data, I'll 
have to work something out.

Hope that makes some sense.

Tim
