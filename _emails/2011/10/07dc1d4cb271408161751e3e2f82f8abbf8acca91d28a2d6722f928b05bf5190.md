## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I first tested the hotpsot using VMware Workstation on my windows XP laptop – When I upgraded to Win 7 my company laptop no longer allows VMs to NAT out so I can’t do that any more.

If you are using NAT (I prefer to use briding – which allows the VM interface to appear as a separate computer on the lan and receive an IP address from that network) you need to enable DHCP in your VMWare environnent which will assig an addrss to the VM and provide routing via the NAT system to the external network - although I am not sure that is possible with VM player. On VM workstation I select the subnet and dhcp function for the virtual interfaces and enable NAT.  Is it possible for you to try bridging the interface?

Hi Glyn,

Thanks for your response. I not clear with your answer and still confusing. Maybe i should explain my setup. Firstly, i installing ubuntu 11.04 in virtual environment which using VM Player. Then, i install step by step following basic installation tutorial in Grase Hotspot website. Everything working smoothly but i got mistake no adding IP in grase hotpot (installation time). The IP is 127.0.0.1 which my computer IP.

I open Grase Hotspot Admin interface in browser by IP, 127.0.01 and access as admin. It working well for first experience. FYI, i using 4g connection for my laptop and enable NAT in VM Player.

I have an AP/Router TP Link model MR3420 for my first hotspot project and flashed with OpenWRT firmware and fresh configuration, no setting yet.

The diagram

4G Broadband => Windows 7 => VM Player => Ubuntu => Grase Hotspot => OpenWRT (AP/Router)

I just stuck in hardware configuration, how to adding IP in router and let Grase Hotspot detects the router while the network in VM Player is NAT and already receive packet from 4G Broadband?

Thank you,

: )

HI syafiqmazli

There is not much else to add, to the on site documentation – but it does assume a working internet connection.  This should be set up to issue DHCP addresses to clients.  The LAN side of the hotspot should be connected to the router, it will get an address and be able to reach the internet.  The wifi access point should need little setup.  It needs no security, set to obtain a DHCP address and given a name SSID.

When you connect the access point to the wifi connection of the hotspot it will issue an address (probably 10.1.0.2) you can connect to the management web page of the hotspot one either address e.g. 10.1.0.1/grase/radmin<http://10.1.0.1/grase/radmin> and from there it is quite simple.  You can find the ip addresses of the grase server by typing ifconfig after logging in.

Hope this helps.

Regards
Glyn
