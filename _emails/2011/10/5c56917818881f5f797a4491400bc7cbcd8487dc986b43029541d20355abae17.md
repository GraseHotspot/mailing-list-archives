It's not implemented yet. But it is planned. I've done some work on 
another project recently that needed multiple access levels, so I'll 
probably borrow that concept for Grase.

I'll let you know when I'm doing it. Any ideas for the best way to 
implement the admin users section then? Currently it's not well 
designed. I'm thinking maybe a table that has username in one column, 
and dropdown boxes in the next to select access level? Not really sure 
so if you have design/interface ideas, let me know!
