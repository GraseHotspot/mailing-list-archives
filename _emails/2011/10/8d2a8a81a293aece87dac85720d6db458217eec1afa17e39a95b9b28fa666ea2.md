## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thanks for that. It seems that Youtube is purposely making it hard to 
cache, and some trickery is being used in Lusca to cache them. I'll look 
into this more later and see if we can support it.
For now, you need to stop squid3 (/etc/init.d/squid3 stop) before 
starting Lusca, and it should just work (I hope).
