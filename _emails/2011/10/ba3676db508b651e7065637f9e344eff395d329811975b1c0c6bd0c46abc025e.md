You can put what ever code you like on the login page through the web 
interface (look under portal customisation). If you change files in the 
source code, your changes will be lost on upgrade. However, as the user 
will leave the login page as soon as they are logged in, any code you 
have on there won't run once they are off that page. You'll need to open 
a popup window, or another window that they have to keep open if you 
want your code to run.

The only way to expire users every X minutes is with a script on the 
server. Something like the following called by a cron job ever X minutes 
will logoff all users.

chilli_query list|awk '{ print $1 }'|xargs chilli_query logout

This will list all the active sessions, get the mac address for all 
sessions, and run the logout command for each one.

My suggested way would be a popup that the user must leave open, it has 
a meta-refresh tag in there to get new ads every minute or so, you have 
a process on the server that checks for all active sessions when the 
last ad refresh was, if it was more than 2 or 3 cycles then you 
disconnect them. This way users who keep the ads window open aren't 
inconvenienced by having to login every X minutes.

Hope that helps.
