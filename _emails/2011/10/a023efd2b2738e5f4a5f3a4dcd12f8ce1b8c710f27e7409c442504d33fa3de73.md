## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}So in my continuing exploration of alternative servers I have been 
exploring drizzle vs mysql. This has lead to some small changes to make 
my SQL more standards compliant.
Interestingly, MySQL was only using about 22Mb of memory, compared to 
Drizzle using 44Mb.
It could be that drizzle is using different index's, or caching more in 
memory (although the memory didn't change from startup, even when 
loading things like the admin log table).

So I don't plan to be changing from MySQL to Drizzle in the near future 
unless I can see a real reason to.

Tim
