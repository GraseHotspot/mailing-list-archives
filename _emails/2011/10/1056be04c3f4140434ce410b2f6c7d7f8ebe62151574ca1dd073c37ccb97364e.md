{% raw  %}It's possible that it had already upgraded overnight.

Just run
dpkg -l "grase*" "coova*"
which will show the correct versions. Hopefully it'll look a bit like 
the following.
ii  coova-chilli   1.2.8-grase3   Wireless LAN Access Point Controller 
(captiv
ii  grase-conf-dns 1.1            Config files for Dnsmasq for the GRASE 
Hotsp
ii  grase-conf-fre 1.7            Config files for FreeRADIUS for the 
GRASE Ho
ii  grase-conf-ope 1.5.2          Config files for OpenVPN for the GRASE 
Hotsp
ii  grase-conf-squ 1.2            Config files for Squid3 for the GRASE 
Hotspo
ii  grase-repo     1.1-5          Config files for OpenVPN for the GRASE 
Hotsp
ii  grase-www-port 3.6.2          Portal files for the GRASE Hotspot System

Chilli should have updated a few days ago, which would have pulled in 
dnsmasq, and grase-conf-dnsmasq. grase-www-portal should have updated 
yesterday.

Let me know if you are still having problems
