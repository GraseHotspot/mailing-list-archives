{% raw  %}Hi Nazanin

The correct way to do this is with translation files. I realise that the 
3.5 release doesn't translate the login form, however the 3.6 release 
which will be out by the end of today does. What language are you using? 
If there isn't already a translation for it, would you consider 
assisting the project by creating a translation?
If you modify the files under /usr/share/grase/ they'll be overwritten 
on each upgrade, so it's best if you do it via translations.
You can modify the placement of the login form as well with all the 
customisations options in the admin interface.
