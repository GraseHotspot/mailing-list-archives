## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}This is currently possible however it's not exposed in the interface.
I'm in the process of coding the interface for it.

I believe it requires the values in kilobits/s however what other
units of measurement do people understand? I know for myself that
kilobits isn't easy to understand, so was thinking of using
Megabytes/second or Megabytes per minute.

What do people think? Also, it'll be a dropdown list of speed values,
what values would people like? I know that here where internet is
between 1.5Mbit/s and 24Mbit/s for a normal ADSL connection, limiting
people to say 256Kbit/s and 1Mbit are some values I'd use. However I
don't know what people overseas may want.
