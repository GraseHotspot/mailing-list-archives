{% raw  %}Hi, And peace to you Tim,

hope you doing fine,
I wrote "rate/min" by mistake in my previous email. but that was my mistake,
I am Pakistani guy from Saudi Arabia, but here in Saudi Arabia as well as in
Pakistan, "rate/sec" is the value that the people are familiar with, and the
option of drop down list is the great idea, I think that will be good like
"256kbyte/sec, 512kbyte/sec, 1MB/sec, 2MB/sec, 4MB/sec" etc,

I Checked the mailing list, and i saw there the solution in insert some
lines in mysql table, but really I never touch mysql, so that is hard for me
to handle,
so waiting for you to udate,

thanks again.

BYE
