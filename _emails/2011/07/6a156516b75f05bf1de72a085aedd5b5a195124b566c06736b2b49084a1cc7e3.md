## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello, and let me first thank Tim for all the work he puts into this wonderful project! We use it here as a means to provide the internet to guests of a small hostel (1 server (celeron 1.2GHz, 512MB RAM) with Ubuntu Server 11.04 and GRASE and some Linksys access points, about 35 users at any time). 

The problem we have is with the latest version (v3.3), this problem did not exist in previous versions. As most of our users are here for the long-term stay, and we charge the internet usage monthly, we were using the Time Limit attribute of the users set to 0 minutes to block the users at the beginning of the month, to get them to pay. Since version v3.3 GRASE interface does not let us set 0 minutes for Time Limit, we can only use 1 minute for example. And even when this 1 minute is up for the user, this value goes in to negative numbers and doesn't really block the user, the system still let's users connect. Previous versions did not let users connect anymore, if the limit was 0 or below. I also tried setting Time Limit attribute (Max-All-Session) in the database raidus, radcheck table, to 0, but the same happens. Users can still connect, and their time limit goes into negative values. As I said before, this only started happening with the latest version, 3.3, version 3.2 was OK, Time Limit worked as expected, setting limit to 0 or anything below that actually blocked users from connecting. 

The next problem is I think squid3 problem.. After some time after restarting the server, our users start observing a strange behavior with opening Google and Youtube or anything google related for that matter, even if a site uses Google Analytics, this problem will show. This problem is, those sites just stop opening, they get resolved normally, but then it's just waiting for eternity.. If you wait long enough, squid throws out an error (unfortunately everything works right now, so I can't provide the exact error) and that is it.. The error has something to do with IPv6 and timeout if I remember correctly, but I'll provide the exact error the next time I get it. 

Again thank you for all your work, and I hope we can resolve this issues together!
