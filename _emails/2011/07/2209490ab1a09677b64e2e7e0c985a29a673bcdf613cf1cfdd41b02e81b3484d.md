## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi All.

I'm still away from work, so haven't been able to get to my emails much.
The Sold and "This Month Used" values are just status bars to allow the 
admin to know how much data has been used in the current (and previous 
month), and how much "quota" has been sold. In the settings page you can 
set the values for these graphs. They are purely for monitoring 
purposes. For example, an organisation might have a 100Gb monthly 
internet quota, so they set the sold graph maximum value to 50Gb and the 
used graph to 100Gb, so they can monitor how much they are selling and 
how much is being used.

At no time will the GRASE Hotspot server stop working and ask for money 
to continue working. Donations are welcomed, but not required.

If thats not clear please let me know and I'll do my best to make it 
clear. I'll probably be away for another week.

Thanks

Tim
