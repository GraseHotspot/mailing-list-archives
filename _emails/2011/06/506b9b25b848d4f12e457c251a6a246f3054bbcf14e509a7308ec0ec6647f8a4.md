## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}3.3 is now in the repository. A simple apt-get update, and apt-get 
upgrade will get everyone upgraded.

It includes the new Italian translation! It has the recurring time 
limits, but not recurring data limits. Also it now has group limits.
Please test these new features, as I've not had much chance to test them 
much. Also, the way the group limits are currently shown in the user 
list page will improve soon. Ideas for how to best convey to users what 
the group limits are when creating a new user are much appreciated. I'm 
thinking maybe having a collapsible section that will just have a table 
with the groups and the limits each group has set.

All feedback welcome!

Thanks

Tim
