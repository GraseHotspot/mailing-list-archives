## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi all Translators.

I'm pushing the 3.3 release today hopefully. It'll include the current 
Italian translation as well as the French!
However, it does introduce a few new strings. Once I push the source to 
the bzr repository, you can grab the English grase.pot file again. This 
time, if you are using poedit, you can tell it to update from POT file. 
So goto the Catalog menu, and select "Update from POT file". Select the 
grase.pot file, and it'll merge the new strings in. I'm not 100% sure, 
but I believe it has a function for only showing new strings that need 
translating.

To give you a quick look at what the new strings are, I've included them 
below. (There may be more or less depending on when you first started 
translating). Also, depending on your preference, I don't mind if the 
"xyz query failed: " messages aren't translated, as they are error 
messages not normally seen. However, if you have the time, I guess it 
does allow for a complete translation!

I also made small formatting to 2 strings (removing the <strong> tags) 
so you may wish to diff your .po file with the ones in the repository as 
I fixed them up in the translated versions as well. Otherwise, when you 
merge it'll just tell you there are 2 new strings and 2 removed strings 
that are basically identical.

Again, thank you everyone who is assisting with translations!

Tim
