## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thanks for that Antonio.

Coova Chilli will allow us to bandwidth 'shape' individual accounts and 
groups of accounts fairly easily. I've not yet implemented the GUI for 
it, but if you want, you can manually add the required attributes into 
the MySQL table until I add an interface.

The attributes you need are:
ChilliSpot-Bandwidth-Max-Down = kbits/second
ChilliSpot-Bandwidth-Max-Up= kbits/second

I'll look at adding this to the interface in a few weeks time.
