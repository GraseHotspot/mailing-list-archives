Ok. So basically a certain user needs to be limited down. (btw, squid 
won't be able to block torrents, you may be able to block trackers, but 
most trackers support https which will prevent you blocking them too. 
Your best bet for blocking torrents is some tricky iptables rules).

To do this, we need to let squid know about users and groups. I have 
some old scripts in /usr/share/grase/www/radmin/scripts that had this 
functionality, however they are not well written and won't work in their 
current state. I'll look at resurrecting them (which I was planning on 
doing eventually anyway), which will allow filtering based on user and 
group.


I'll open a bug on trac.grasehotspot.org so you can monitor that for 
when I've finished it.
