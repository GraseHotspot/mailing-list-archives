## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi all,

I have 4 questions/problems:

1) Ticket size
The mini screen displays the remaining bandwidth balance as at the first of the month.
How can I change this to show the total issued instead?

2) 5 Gb tickets
All 5 Gb tickets are shown as being 4 Gb in size on the mini screen. (The status and admin screens reflect the size correctly!)
How do I fix this?


3) Host resources
I have Grase sitting in a VirtualBox VM with a WAN IP of 192.168.1.3, the machine hosting the VM has an IP of 192.168.1.2 and the ADSL router is 192.168.1.1.
I have several php apps (behind apache) on the host (192.168.1.2) which I wish to make freely available over my network, but in order to access them I have to perform a login via Grase.
I have added 192.168.1.2 to walled garden allowed hosts, but that does not fix my problem.
How do I fix this?

4) Curious problem
As mentioned in point 2 above, I have issued tickets of 5 Gb size.
One of my customers experienced a weird problem with his 5 Gb ticket, namely: when he reached the 4 Gb usage mark Grase/radius logged him out and presented him with the "you have reached your b/w limit" message on successive attempts to login. He purchased another 5 Gb ticket from me and the exact same thing occurred when that ticket reached 4 Gb. He then logged in successfully with the first ticket and was able to use it again. The second ticket however steadfastly refuses to allow him back in. (I replaced it with a fresh 1 Gb ticket to solve the problem swiftly.)
I have other 5 Gb customers who have used up their tickets without any such error.
Any ideas how to solve this?

Thanks,
Tim S{% endraw %}
