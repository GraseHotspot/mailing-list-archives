## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello,
I installed Grace on Ubuntu (GUI) latest version.
I have made all the updates and everything seems to work ok (the install
guide was very simple).

I have a problem though making the WAP4410N CISCO Access points to work.
I just can't get an IP from the Hotspot from my wireless laptop. I can't
ping the Access points from the Server nor the opposite.

The only setting i have made to the Access Points is to change the SID name
and manually the IP of the Access point the Gateway (Gateway is the server
10.1.0.1).

Any ideas what can be wrong?

Thank you for your time.


Thomas
