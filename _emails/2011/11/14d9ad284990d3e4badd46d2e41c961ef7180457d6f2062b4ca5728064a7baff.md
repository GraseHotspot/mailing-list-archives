{% raw  %}Hi Tim.

Seems I didn't respond to your previous email. Sorry. It's currently 
exam time and it seems to have gotten lost in my inbox.

Currently I'm redoing the status/login javascript. Once that's done I 
hope to make it clearer what a user has been allocated.

This sounds like a 32bit integer issue. Javascript is supposed to be 
64bit by default, so it must be somewhere else. Can you open a bug for 
it (trac.grasehotspot.org) so I remember to look at it after exams?

Can you show me the contents of /etc/chilli/local.conf ?
Testing that here it all seems to be working fine. The important line 
will be something like
uamallowed=192.168.1.2
Just make sure you are running the latest chilli in the repository, as 
earlier ones didn't read the settings properly.

I'm guessing it must have something to do with using the whole amount in 
one go? Again, it sounds like a 32bit integer error.
Can you do a test (I don't have a 32bit test machine setup atm) by 
downloading (just do it from your local server) 5Gb in one go, and try 
doing it in parts. It may also be possible that the other 5Gb tickets 
are being used over the month marker (i.e. the 1st of the month) which 
IIRC is when the radacct data is archived, so the ticket limit is 
actually below the 4Gb mark when they approach the limit. (It moves all 
the acct data to a monthly total table, then decrements the limit so we 
only have to lookup this current months usage to see if they have 
reached their limit).

Hope that helps.

Tim
