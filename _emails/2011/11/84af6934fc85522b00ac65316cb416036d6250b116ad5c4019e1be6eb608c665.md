Hi Oscar.

If the tables are correct in mysql, then it will most likely be a
password issue. Try reinstalling the grase-conf-freeradius package and
see if it works after that.
Otherwise there is a file in /etc/grase/ (iirc, not at my computer
atm) that contains the mysql passwords, check that the radius one
actually works. I had a problem early on where the dpkg db system
didn't set the password correctly, but could never find out what
caused the problem and it only happened once in a blue moon.
