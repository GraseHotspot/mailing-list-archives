1.2.8 is the latest chilli. 1.2.6 doesn't get the settings from the 
radmin interface, hence the problem. I should check the dependencies so 
that all newer versions depend on the right chilli version. Make sure 
you do an "apt-get update; apt-get upgrade", it may even need an 
"apt-get dist-upgrade" if it's not pulling in the newest versions. Do 
you have the grase-repo package installed? It should handle the updates 
automatically.
