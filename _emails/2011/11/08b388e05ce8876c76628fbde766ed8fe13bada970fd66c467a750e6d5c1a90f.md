{% raw  %}Hi Paul.

The easiest way to work this out is say what it should be, then check.

Max-Octets, Max-Daily-Session should be radgroupcheck, because they are 
converted into Session-Timeout and Max-Total-Octets. Idle-Timeout is not 
set per group or user atm, hence it's a ChilliSpot-Config attribute 
which means it gets returned to chilli when it requests it's config 
attributes, so the default config is based on those attributes. 
ChilliSpot-Bandwidth-Max* should be radgroupreply.

So the bandwidth things are in groupreply and work.

Looks like you are right, Max-* should be in groupcheck and are 
currently in groupreply. It also appears that I was mistaken about being 
able to override group limits when you create a user. I'll have to 
change some code and have a play to see what is right.

By default, read_groups is yes, but it wouldn't hurt to explicitly set 
it encase the defaults change at some point.

The idea was that the userattributes replaced the group attributes 
(allowing you to override some settings). But it seems I may have to 
rethink this now.

Thanks for pointing all this out.
