This shouldn't be happening.
Have you changed any firewall rules?
Have you added any computer accounts (MAC based accounts).

What is the ip range you are using for the hotspot, and what are the 
ip's that the mac's are using? Do you have an IPv6 router somewhere on 
the network?

Lastly, is your LAN network physically separate from your WAN network? 
Or do they share hardware at some point? The only point that should 
connect the WAN and LAN networks should be the hotspot machine with one 
network card on the LAN, and one on the WAN.
