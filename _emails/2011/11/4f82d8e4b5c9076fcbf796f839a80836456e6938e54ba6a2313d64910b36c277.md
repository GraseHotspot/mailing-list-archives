## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hmm. It seems that ArpOn probably won't help.
" that requires a daemon in every host of the connection for 
authenticate each host through an authentication of type cooperative 
between the hosts."
You can't expect all the hotspot users to install this daemon to protect 
themselves. I'd be recommending users use SSL for protection. If someone 
arp spoofs, it'll slow down the network, but I was sure there are arp 
deamons out there that monitor for those spoofs and "counter spoofs".
