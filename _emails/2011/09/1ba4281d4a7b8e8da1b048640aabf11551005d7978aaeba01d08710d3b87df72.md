## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Jb,

There should be nightly backups done. /var/backups/grase/database/
should have the nightly backups. There are 2 sql files per night, one
for the radius database, one for the radmin database. There should
also be a tgz file that contains both the files compressed. (I'll have
to look at making the script remove the files once it compresses
them).

When you do a reinstall, make sure the packages are installed before
restoring the databases.

Tim
p.s. If you have uploaded a custom logo it needs to be saved separately.
