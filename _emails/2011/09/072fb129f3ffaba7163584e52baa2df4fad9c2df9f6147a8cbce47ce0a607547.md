## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hey.

I've tried everything I can think of. Done lots of looking on the net. 
It appears to not be possible. Is there are reason you need the 12th of 
the month? It's easy to do "first day of next month" which will always 
work, however it doesn't seem to be possible to get the "next 12th". If 
there is lots of demand for something like this, then I'll see if it can 
be implemented somehow.
