## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}See the demo, in particular the settings page. login guest, guest
http://grasehotspot.org/grase/radmin/settings

See http://trac.grasehotspot.org/browser/files/usr/share/grase/www/radmin/includes/page_functions.inc.php#L177
and http://trac.grasehotspot.org/browser/files/usr/share/grase/www/radmin/includes/page_functions.inc.php#L130
Both these functions have an array of values. The time array is minute
values. The data array is money values and the data value is
calculated on that.
The easiest way to expose this is in the settings page, but the actual
interface is the question. In terms of HTML forms, what is the best
way of allowing custom values in here (remembering that its an array
of values).
I'm sure I can just show it "1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 20" etc in a text field,
and leave it up to the user to ensure that they keep the format
correct.
