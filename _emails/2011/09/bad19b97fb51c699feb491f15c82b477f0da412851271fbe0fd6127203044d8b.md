## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}There currently isn't any way to do this.
Suggestions welcome for the best way to implement this. When it was
first written the idea was we charged a fix amount per time unit (or
data) and hence the only option was how much this fixed amount was.
i.e. 1hr is $10, so 2hr is $20

I assume from the question that you want to give discounts? So 1hr is
$10, 2hr is $15, 4hr is $20 etc. (So not a linear scale?)

Currently the "price" is very loosely connected to the units you
purchase. I plan to eventually make the money side more important (so
we can have things like paypal purchases of data/time).

Suggestions for implementation welcome.
