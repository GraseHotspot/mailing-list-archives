## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}The address is hard coded in a number of template and js files in the
uam web directory. What it means if you have changed the address, is
that when chilli redirects to the login page, the login page
eventually needs to redirect back to chilli and uses the 10.1.0.1
address. Maybe we can rely on dns in the future, but hard coding an ip
address ensured that even if the DNS was setup wrong, it still worked.
