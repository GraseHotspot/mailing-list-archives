Comment:

 Currently not going to fix this. As we can now have custom CSS and HTML,
 for someone who wants to really customise the pages, they can use SCP/SSH
 to upload images and then override the logo with their own via CSS.
 The logo is currently defined in CSS via the following
 {{{
 #page {
     background: url("/grase/images/logo.png") right top no-repeat;
 }
 }}}
 To override it, in the custom CSS just add something like
 {{{
 #page {
     background: none;
 }
 }}}
 or
 {{{
 #page {
     background: url("/images/mylogo.jpg") top left no-repeat;
 }
 }}}

 If the main CSS is disabled (now possible) then this override isn't even
 needed as the logo won't be shown.
