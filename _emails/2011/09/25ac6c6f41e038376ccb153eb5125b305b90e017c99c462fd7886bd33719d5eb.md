## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}So turning off Autofill allows it to work totally?
What are the symptoms when autofill is turned on? I'll see if this can
be disabled from the hotspot side.

Regarding antivirus. Avast can update automatically as it's in the
UAMDOMAINS. This should be customisable in the interface now, so I'll
file a bug to remove the old reference in the config files. The reason
for it's existence was we used to run an avast mirror so updates would
be free and fast.
If any other antivirus is updating before login, let m know.
