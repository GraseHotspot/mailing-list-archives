## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Recently we have discovered a problem related to iOS devices (iPads and
iPhones).

When an user with such device enters to the wifi network controlled by a
grase hotspot equipment, and this iOS device sleeps for a while (less than
5 minutes), it is not able to automatically reconnect to the network. The
user must check an option for automatic connect to this network.
 
This is strange, as we have another installations controlled by zyxel and
ruckus hotspots, and this problem does not exists. In those installations,
as soon as the user validates its login data, the wifi is registered as
private network on the iphone or ipad, and the automatic connect check
disappears and the device is able to automatically reconnect the network
as soon it sees the wifi network, without any user intervention.
On the other hand, we had no problems using Android phones and tablets
Any one has seen this strange behavior or something similar?
 
Best regards,
 
Hector Blanco de Frutos.
