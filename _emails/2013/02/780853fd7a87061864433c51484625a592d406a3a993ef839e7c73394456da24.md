It should have only been the 64bit debian that was affected, as the 32bit coova-chilli package was compiled with libssl0.9.8 support, and only the 64bit one was accidently compiled with libssl1.0.0

Package: coova-chilli
Version: 1.2.9-grase3
Architecture: i386
Maintainer: Coova Technologies, LLC <su***t@coova.com>
Installed-Size: 2112
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.4), libssl0.9.8 (>= 0.9.8m-1), grase-conf-squid3, grase-conf-dnsmasq

Package: coova-chilli
Version: 1.2.9-grase3
Architecture: amd64
Maintainer: Coova Technologies, LLC <su***t@coova.com>
Installed-Size: 2364
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.4), libssl1.0.0 (>= 1.0.0), grase-conf-squid3, grase-conf-dnsmasq

I have successfully installed Grase on 32bit Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, Debian 6, as well as 64bit Ubuntu 12.04. My dev machine is currently building test environments for 64bit and 32bit Debian 6, Debian 7, Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 so I can test in all environments. It's a big pain, but will help make sure I don't miss a silly library issue like this.

The best way to avoid this will probably be compiling the packages in Debian 6, as it doesn't have libssl1.0.0 and so can't try and use the newer ssl. Alternatively, I may see about compiling a non-ssl package depending on what the SSL does in Coova Chilli, or compiling with both libssl versions and changing the packaging to contain both versions.

And seeing as 1.3.0 has been out since October, I need to try and
package the newer version too.

Hello.

We have installed the Grase Hotspot in a hotel, and we have discovered
that we have problems trying to Access the APs (Access Point's) located on
the LAN network (10.59.*.*) from the hotspot computer. We can't access
their web panel, and not even ping them.

On the other hand, if we do it from a computer located inside the LAN
network, like a netbook or a smartphone, the AP's respond and are
accessible. I really don't know if this is a normal behavior, and thus if
I have to enable some option or do something to view the Aps from the
hotspot device. For us this is very important, as we need to remotely
monitor those network equipment.



Best regards,

Hector Blanco de Frutos.

Hi Hector.

Are you saying the Hotspot LAN is 10.59.0.0 or that the AP's are on that
LAN and the Hotspot LAN is the default 10.1.0.0?

If the Hotspot LAN and the AP's LAN is different, then you obviously can't
access the AP LAN from the Hotspot LAN due to them being in different
subnets. (And assuming you set the client computer on the LAN side to the
right subnet, it'll be able to access the AP's)

You /should/ be able to access the AP's from the Hotspot server, IF they
are in the Hotspot LAN. However the risk with that is that the AP's ip's
may conflict with a client ip unless they are outside the DHCP range.
However, this isn't the ideal way to set it up, as you ideally want your
management network separate from your client network for security purposes.
The easy way to do this is with VLAN's. Use the untagged interface (i.e.
eth1) for the Hotspot, but use a VLAN (say eth1.10) for the AP's management
IP's. Seeing as the Grase network is a layer 2 network, the AP's shouldn't
be touching the traffic anyway and should be routing it as Layer 2, so the
AP's ips don't need to be in the Grase LAN.

I hope that makes some sense.

Thanks for your replies I have changes the options in the file local.conf but still no go unfortunately.

I installed a new disk with Ubuntu 12.04 and all worked fine but after a few restarts the issue came back.
(kept the old disk to test afterwards if it would all be fine again)

Bellow here the asked information.
