In 3.7.7.6, the dhcp START & END functions can now be set from the
Grase_admin "Coova Chill Settings" tab and works OK for me even after
rebooting.  Perhaps setting them here will help (easier to access anyway).

I've found that It is touchy however. I got the same error as Paul when I
had my netmask set to 255.255.0.0. Setting it to 255.255.255.0 fixed the
error for me. I haven't tested it but I think maybe that dhcp END has to be
set higher than 255 if a wider netmask is being used.

Also there doesn't seem to be a way to see what the dhcp settings are
currently set to as once set they disappear from the text fields and also
from /etc/chilli/local.conf, so this appears to be a chilli issue.

I can live with these issues, but perhaps there needs to be some warning
text for the unwary placed along-side the Grase dhcp START/END input fields
Tim?


Cheers,

Bob
