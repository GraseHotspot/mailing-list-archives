{% raw  %}#98: Feature  Request: Include computer account's "comments" field in "Monitor
Sessions"  admin page
-----------------------------+-----------------
 Reporter:  bob hunt         |      Owner:  tim
     Type:  enhancement      |     Status:  new
 Priority:  minor            |  Milestone:  3.9
Component:  Admin Interface  |    Version:  3.7
 Keywords:                   |
-----------------------------+-----------------
 The "monitor Sessions" page shows the username of computer accounts  as
 the computer's mac address, as you would expect. However in use, this is
 quite unergonomic, frequently requiring navigation to the
 "Users"/"Computers" page to ascertain who's computer you are actually
 looking at (as recorded in the "Comments" field).

 It would be great if this information was directly available on the
 "Monitor Sessions" page.
