Just to let you know that I have had a Netcomm V210P adapter operating
successfully with Pennytel through Grase for some months now. Several
other devices I have tried were either no-go or unstable so I agree,
voip is very touchy, but it is possible.

Setup is normal but you must authorize the mac address of the device,
and every other device in your network which the connection may
traverse. I use a mesh network, so have every node's mac authorized in
Grase and I've also found that a daily reboot of each node helps to
keep the voip stable.

I have also found that smartphones seem to run voip more easily than
adapters, just needing their mac address authorised in grase to be
able to make and receive calls.

Another option for getting a voip adapter working behind Grase is to
find a provider which supports using a stun server. These are free
external severs with the sole purpose of allowing  voip to work behind
nat.

Cheers,

Bob
