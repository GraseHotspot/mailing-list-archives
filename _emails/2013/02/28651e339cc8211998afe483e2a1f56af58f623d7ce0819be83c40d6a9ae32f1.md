## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim.

In my scenario, I have the following:

-hotspot:   10.59.1.1

-AP1:           10.59.1.100

 

Obviously, on the same physical network.

The hotspot can't reach the AP. The ping is unable to get a response.

But, when I connect directly to the AP and force it to ping to 10.59.1.1
(the hotspot), 

the hotspot machine starts to view it and to get reply from the ping.

Passed some minutes (maybe more than half an hour), the ping fails again.

And works again whe the AP pings back to the hotspot.

It is a very strange problem, and we had this in both a hotel and also our
office,

and is not restricted to one brand of access point, as we use mikrotik,
deliberant,

tp-link, dlink.

 

Best regards,

Hector Blanco de Frutos.

Hi Hector.

 

Are you saying the Hotspot LAN is 10.59.0.0 or that the AP's are on that

LAN and the Hotspot LAN is the default 10.1.0.0?

 

If the Hotspot LAN and the AP's LAN is different, then you obviously can't

access the AP LAN from the Hotspot LAN due to them being in different

subnets. (And assuming you set the client computer on the LAN side to the

right subnet, it'll be able to access the AP's)

 

You /should/ be able to access the AP's from the Hotspot server, IF they

are in the Hotspot LAN. However the risk with that is that the AP's ip's

may conflict with a client ip unless they are outside the DHCP range.

However, this isn't the ideal way to set it up, as you ideally want your

management network separate from your client network for security
purposes.

The easy way to do this is with VLAN's. Use the untagged interface (i.e.

eth1) for the Hotspot, but use a VLAN (say eth1.10) for the AP's
management

IP's. Seeing as the Grase network is a layer 2 network, the AP's shouldn't

be touching the traffic anyway and should be routing it as Layer 2, so the

AP's ips don't need to be in the Grase LAN.

 

I hope that makes some sense.

 

Tim
