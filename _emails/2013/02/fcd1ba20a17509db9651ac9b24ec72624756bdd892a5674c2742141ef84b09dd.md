---------------------------+-----------------
 Reporter:  tim            |      Owner:  tim
     Type:  defect         |     Status:  new
 Priority:  major          |  Milestone:  3.8
Component:  Other Backend  |    Version:  3.7
 Keywords:                 |
---------------------------+-----------------
 Some coova settings ( on the coova chilli settings page) don't make chilli
 restart as they are put in DB and not in the network settings file, which
 is what triggers the chilli restart. Need to somehow bump the last updated
 part
