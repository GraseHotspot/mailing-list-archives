One thing RPM packaging have over Deb packaging is that we can uninstall any installed package, by obsoleting it.
That is, an obsoleted package will be uninstalled by the package manager when instaling any package that obsolete another one, and the user can do little to prevent it, short of not installing the package that obsoletes the old package.

If the Debian package manager tools doesn't have this feature, you could release an updated package, that contains No files, which will have the sole purpose of disableing itself. Maybe have a script run when instaling the new updated package, that will explicitly stop and remove the files that is responsible for this. Then all those installations that still send you mail, will stop upon next system update cycle.

You should to take into account that many of the sysadmins which manage these systems do not read this list, and therefore doesn't know that they should manually uninstall the package. Some of them might not even know how to do that. (Yes, such people really do exist.)
