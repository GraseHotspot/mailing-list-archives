This will probably change as I realised that all CRON functions should 
be things you are ok with unauthenticated users doing. Deleting users is 
not something we want them to be able to do, as the call to delete these 
users should be made based on how your run your system. For people doing 
ticket based batches of fixed limits, then deleting these users should 
be ok.

I'll add a GUI for this instead, probably in the users section, that 
also confirms the number of users that will be deleted before doing it.
