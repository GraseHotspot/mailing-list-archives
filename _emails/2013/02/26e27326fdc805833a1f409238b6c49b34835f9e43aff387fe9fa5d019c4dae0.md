## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}If you have been using the Grase Hotspot since before the middle of last 
year, you may have installed the Monit package that was in the 
repository back then. It is labelled grase-conf-monit. This is all well 
and good, except that it still sends me emails when ever something 
happens, as it was a package left over from before I released Grase to 
the public. It has not been in the repository for about 12 months now, 
however some people still have it installed. See 
http://trac.grasehotspot.org/ticket/54 for the bug about the emails.

My server does reject these emails, however I still get about 100 a day 
trying to come in. Previously the emails have been accepted by the 
server, and then dropped. However starting today I am rejecting them at 
SMTP time. This may start to show up as mail delivery reports on some 
systems.

It has been recommended (requested?) for some time that you uninstall 
this package (and probably also the monit package) as it's "leaking 
data" and not maintained. If you wish to use monit yourself, please 
remove my package so your monit settings are active and I stop getting 
these email attempts.

To check if you have the package installed, run 'dpkg -l grase-conf-monit'
If it looks like below, you are all good. If not, please uninstall it

$ dpkg -l grase-conf-monit
dpkg-query: no packages found matching grase-conf-monit


Thanks

Tim
