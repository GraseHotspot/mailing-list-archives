{% raw  %}Hi Peter,

I think that only the totals are archived, so session details are lost (it
looks like this happens after 2 months anyway). I've put a warning text
next to the button to that effect.

In most cases, I find that the loss of session history data doesn't matter
to the client (I always ask).

Now that Tim has fixed the 4Gig data limit bug in chilli (thanks Tim!)
there is the alternative of topping up the clients data limit up to 97Gig I
think, which of course avoids the premature loss of history data.
