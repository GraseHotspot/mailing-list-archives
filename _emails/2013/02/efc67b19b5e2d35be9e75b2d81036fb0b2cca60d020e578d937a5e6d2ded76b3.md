It should have only been the 64bit debian that was affected, as the 
32bit coova-chilli package was compiled with libssl0.9.8 support, and 
only the 64bit one was accidently compiled with libssl1.0.0

Package: coova-chilli
Version: 1.2.9-grase3
Architecture: i386
Maintainer: Coova Technologies, LLC <su***t@coova.com>
Installed-Size: 2112
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.4), libssl0.9.8 (>= 0.9.8m-1), grase-conf-squid3, 
grase-conf-dnsmasq

Package: coova-chilli
Version: 1.2.9-grase3
Architecture: amd64
Maintainer: Coova Technologies, LLC <su***t@coova.com>
Installed-Size: 2364
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.4), libssl1.0.0 (>= 1.0.0), grase-conf-squid3, 
grase-conf-dnsmasq

I have successfully installed Grase on 32bit Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, Debian 
6, as well as 64bit Ubuntu 12.04. My dev machine is currently building 
test environments for 64bit and 32bit Debian 6, Debian 7, Ubuntu 12.04 
and 12.10 so I can test in all environments. It's a big pain, but will 
help make sure I don't miss a silly library issue like this.

The best way to avoid this will probably be compiling the packages in 
Debian 6, as it doesn't have libssl1.0.0 and so can't try and use the 
newer ssl. Alternatively, I may see about compiling a non-ssl package 
depending on what the SSL does in Coova Chilli, or compiling with both 
libssl versions and changing the packaging to contain both versions.
