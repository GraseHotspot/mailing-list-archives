No it's not. it's related to Debian Stable in general, not just 64 bit. We had to install Ubuntu on a separate machine because our 32 bit Debian server didn't have v1.0.0.

All Debian Squeeze (6.0) architectures have libssl0.9.8 and not 1.0.0, and there is a reason for that. The software versions in it is tested to make sure it's compatible with the other software. If one uprade sofftware to a nbew version, the software often comes with new functionality. Sometimes that introduce new bugs resulting in other pacdkages also needs to be updated, wich in turn can lead to other packages needs updating, and so on. Usually it doesn't, but it's not unheard of.

The policy is that if a bug or security hole is discovered and fixed in the new version, they find the patch that fixed it and apply it to the released version. Mandriva and Mageia does the same.

It's called Stable for a reason. :-)=
