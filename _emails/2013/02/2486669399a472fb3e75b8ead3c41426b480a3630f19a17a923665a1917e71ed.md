## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello.

We have installed the Grase Hotspot in a hotel, and we have discovered
that we have problems trying to Access the APs (Access Point's) located on
the LAN network (10.59.*.*) from the hotspot computer. We can't access
their web panel, and not even ping them.

On the other hand, if we do it from a computer located inside the LAN
network, like a netbook or a smartphone, the AP's respond and are
accessible. I really don't know if this is a normal behavior, and thus if
I have to enable some option or do something to view the Aps from the
hotspot device. For us this is very important, as we need to remotely
monitor those network equipment.

 

Best regards,

Hector Blanco de Frutos.
