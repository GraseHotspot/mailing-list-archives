## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi tim,

Yup, the /var/log/squid3/access.log is empty with 0 byte file size and only
the cache.log is not empty with some cache activities logged.

To tell you the truth, i don't know how to change squid settings,but i did
manually change some coova chilli settings in order to make the dns to
respond in 3.7.6.

Somehow, recently I have setup a new server running a fresh installed
3.7.7.6 grasehotspot on an ubuntu server 12.04.1. But, unfortunately, i
still got the same Squid3 problem (shown in attachment).  Though it is not
a critical item, but it would be great to have those features especially
where sometimes I need to monitor my children's  online activities.

I am really happy to see how this wonderful hotspot software had evolved.
So far, this is the most stable hotspot system having wonderful hotspot
features i have ever used.  I am looking forward to donate to this project
, thanks for initiating this project.

Finally, hope anyone having the same problem care to share some tips here.

regards,
darnalis

I've check in my 12.04 server build, and squid3 logging is working
properly. So unless you've modified your squid3 files somehow, it should
just work.
Can you confirm that /var/log/squid3/access.log is empty and not having
anything logged to it?

Tim
