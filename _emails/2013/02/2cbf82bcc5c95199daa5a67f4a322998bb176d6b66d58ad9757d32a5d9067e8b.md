Hi Hector.

Are you saying the Hotspot LAN is 10.59.0.0 or that the AP's are on that
LAN and the Hotspot LAN is the default 10.1.0.0?

If the Hotspot LAN and the AP's LAN is different, then you obviously can't
access the AP LAN from the Hotspot LAN due to them being in different
subnets. (And assuming you set the client computer on the LAN side to the
right subnet, it'll be able to access the AP's)

You /should/ be able to access the AP's from the Hotspot server, IF they
are in the Hotspot LAN. However the risk with that is that the AP's ip's
may conflict with a client ip unless they are outside the DHCP range.
However, this isn't the ideal way to set it up, as you ideally want your
management network separate from your client network for security purposes.
The easy way to do this is with VLAN's. Use the untagged interface (i.e.
eth1) for the Hotspot, but use a VLAN (say eth1.10) for the AP's management
IP's. Seeing as the Grase network is a layer 2 network, the AP's shouldn't
be touching the traffic anyway and should be routing it as Layer 2, so the
AP's ips don't need to be in the Grase LAN.

I hope that makes some sense.

Tim
