Maybe have a script run when instaling the new updated package, that will explicitly stop and remove the files that is responsible for this. Then all those installations that still send you mail, will stop upon next system update cycle.

Thanks Johnny

I am aware that many people probably aren't on this list. Debian has a 
way of obsoleting packages too. And I can use the grase-repo package to 
force an uninstall of something if needed. I've kinda been trying to 
avoid doing that, but the more I look at it, the more I'm thinking it's 
a good idea. It wasn't until today that I realised how many systems 
still tried to send me monit emails. Originally I thought it was just 
one, and that particular one I know doesn't auto update ether (still on 
version 3.1), so hadn't thought of forcing an uninstall on something 
that didn't appear to be a big problem.
