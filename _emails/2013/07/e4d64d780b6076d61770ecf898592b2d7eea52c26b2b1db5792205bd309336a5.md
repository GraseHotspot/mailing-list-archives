The services monitor page is an obsolete left over from a few years ago. 
The system Grase was originally in was more tightly controlled, and so 
the filtering was easy to include. Unfortunately that filter is very 
restrictive and difficult to adjust, so it wasn't suitable to include 
with the public version.

You are best to investigate how you can use Squid to do any filtering 
you need, as you can add your own custom squid configs to the squid.d 
directory.
