This is the normal option. You are limited to 100m ethernet cable 
between switch and each AP point.
You can also use better antennas on AP. This means directional antennas. 
Their diagram of Tx and Rx is nor circular then concentrated at narrow 
angle vertically and/or horizontally. Clients should be in eye of sight 
with AP antenna and their diagrams.
For longer distances, repeater is an option combined also with 
appropriate antennas. With repeater you will have drop of theoretical 
speed by 50% in wifi channel.
Better option then repeater is "link". You will need two devices acting 
as "link", and third device at far end connected with cable to second 
"link" device.
It is possible to use 5GHz devices for link , you will get more speed on 
link up to +200Mbs and get distances up to 30 km or more.

Yes. It is perfectly same setting as when connecting directly to server.
> Same SSID on each access point, and separate each on a different channel?
Yes, exactly. Just keep in mind to choose at least 3 channel apart 
between two AP if they are close to each other.
And of course check first already occupied channels and their signals 
strength in your neighborhood. Foreign channels with weak signals at 
your area of coverage  are possible useful if no empty one available.
> Turning off dhcp in each access ponit and turning off wds?
Yes, DHPC definitely should be off. WDS depends of what are you building 
up as well as about the device software. Some devices need WDS to act as 
repeater or link.
You should also assign static IP to each AP device how you can access 
them, to see what is going on, change setting if necessary or else. This 
way it is possible to access device on link segment and manage it. At 
link setup, network setting at each device need to be set as "bridge".

I set static IPs at six of my  AP devices currently in the air. I used 
lower part of range: 10.1.0.2 to 10.1.0.7 . It is not a problem for 
grase/chilli DHCP to keep those reserved because all APs are always "ON" 
theoretically. Better way is to limit Grase DHCP range out of these. 
Well I didn't yet.

I have one AP (Airlive outdoor with panel antenna 9dbi). One repater 
line consisting of AP with self-made 18-elements LOG-periodic antena 
(15dbi) and AP with panel antenna 9dbi. Also I have one 5GHz Link 
consisting of two Ubiquity AirGrids with parabolic antennas (25dbi) and 
Linksys DD-WRT 54GL router at end. This is 500 meters far location.
Those LOG and Panel antennas are facing each other and they are 
aproximately 300meters away . It is interesting that both devices able 
to connect clients in own nearby because neither Tx/Rx diagram is not 
strictly directional. In nearby (say up to 30meters) of any directional 
antenna, there are always side and back RF fields which is strong enough 
for client's normal operation. This efect is used at the repeater end 
where clients are getting WiFi connection by those side emisions only, 
while main antenna direction is oriented to see far LOG antenna.


If you need more details I will be glad to help.
