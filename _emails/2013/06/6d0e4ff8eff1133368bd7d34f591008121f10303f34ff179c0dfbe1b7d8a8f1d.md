 Hello,

 I'm a brand new user of grase. I'll be contributing a Vietnam and a Korean
 translation soon, and maybe gentoo ebuilds and a sabayon equo binary
 repository.

 Tim you'd be pleased to know I am a refugee from Australia thanks to the
 country getting special homosexuals with guns running around (GLLO Gay and
 Lesbian Liaison Officers) that can accuse you of the crime of knowing they
 are gay and you have been discriminated against by them(60c NSW Crimes
 act) - as seen on truthnews.com.au (front page) search for my name. Don't
 worry your church is next. Gays are exempt from the anti-discrimination
 act yet are pushing to non-exempt churches so they can sue them again
 (Wayout vs Bretheren case)for not allowing gay youth sleepover camps to
 talk about sex on church land. see my youtube.com/hojuruku  channel for
 the ABC News video about that.

 Please improve your error handling to give more specific error messages
 that are useful.
   ErrorHandling::fatal_error('Creating Log Entry failed: '.
 $affected->getMessage().' - '.$affected->getUserinfo());

 Gives me an error telling me everything is my fault:
 "Creating Log Entry failed: MDB2 Error: unknown error - _doQuery: [Error
 message: Could not execute statement] [Last executed query: INSERT INTO
 adminlog (`timestamp`, username, ipaddress, action) VALUES ('2013-06-22
 19:41:03', NULL, '172.16.16.43', 'Invalid Login')] [Native code: 1665]
 [Native message: Cannot execute statement: impossible to write to binary
 log since BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT and at least one table uses a storage
 engine limited to row-based logging. InnoDB is limited to row-logging when
 transaction isolation level is READ COMMITTED or READ UNCOMMITTED.] "

 BTW What is the default password for the server? admin/hotspotadmin?
 That's what I tried.

 Can you make some docs for installing from sources on other distro and
 using config files to jump start a system (load in passwords site settings
 etc from files).

 Hope to have her up and running soon. Have you tried the coova netfilter
 module? That would be a great thing to upgrade to kernel 3.9 ;)
