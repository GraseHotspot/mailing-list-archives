## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi guys

I'm trying to connect my nanostation as AP to a HotSpot. My problem i 
just can't get it to communicate with Grase Hotspot. What IP should i 
set it to on lan and WAN. It also appears to have RADIUS MAC 
Authentication which has Auth Server  and Accounting Server which 
suggests my Grase server. But still they don't communicate.

Please help





{% endraw %}
