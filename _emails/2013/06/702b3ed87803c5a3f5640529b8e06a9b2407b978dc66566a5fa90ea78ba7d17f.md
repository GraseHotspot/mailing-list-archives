Currently it would seem like it doesn't. ;-)=

what ever you decide to do, you need to list on the web site, maybe on the install page, which distros and versions you currently support.
I think that is enouch to resolve a lot of the problems people have getting Grase to work. Then people will know which Debian and Ubuntu to install, and be sure everything works.

Which is why you need to support multiple releases.

This is why you should support the LTS releases. Then they don't have to update twice a year.
I think you should think about supporting the ubuntu LTS releases (Long Time Support), which are supported by Ubuntu for several years.

Likewise for Debian, support the stable and the previous stable releases, which currently is Debian 6 and 7. the reasoning behind is that you need to account for the fact that many don't upgrade to latest stable until quite some time after current stable is out, so they can test things to verify things would work.

So I think you need to have two Debian repos, and maybe one Ubuntu repo.
it might be a little work to establish, but once it's done and working it should be easy to push updates to each release. Plus libssl would work itself out, as all I had to do to make coova-chilli install on Debian 7 was to rebuild the package on Debian 7, and install using gdebi (from gdebi-core)
