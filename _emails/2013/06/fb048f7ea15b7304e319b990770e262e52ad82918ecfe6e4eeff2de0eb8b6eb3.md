## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

I personally would prefer to see that it works easily and well on one 
version of one distro rather than having it probably work on a bunch of 
them.

Frankly, if you are spending your time making the software work on 
several distros then you are not spending that time improving the 
features etc.

Obviously you will have to support later distros at some point, but 
perhaps you could give a time period. Picking a figure out of the air 
here, but if you support every second LTS version I can't see a big 
problem with that. To my mind there are only two reasons to go to a 
newer distro: 1. Drivers for new hardware not supported, 2. Cool 
features in the new version. I do not see that computers that run Grase 
should even care about the cool new features, and Grase runs really well 
on hardware that is not the latest, so I do not see any reason for you 
to expend energy on keeping up with really recent distros.

Just my thoughts...

     Peter
