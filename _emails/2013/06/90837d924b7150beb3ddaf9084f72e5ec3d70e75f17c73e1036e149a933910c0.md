## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi,

Sorry for my english, i'll do my best for write an good english.

I install grase hotspot and i think it's the solution for my project.

But i have 2 problems :

Problem 1 :
When i choose the parameters "fr_FR" in settings, users don't have the
login form complete, fileds "user" and "password" don't displayed, they
must use the "no javascript" way.
If i choose the en_US, the login form is complete in javascript mode, we
have user and password field.

Problem 2 :
When i click on user for show user logs (http usage...) there is no logs.
We have to enable somthing to have logs?
In France, the law said that we have to log hotspot usage and keep it 1
year.

I have search on web, but nothing help me.

Thank's for helping me.

Best regards

Nicolas
