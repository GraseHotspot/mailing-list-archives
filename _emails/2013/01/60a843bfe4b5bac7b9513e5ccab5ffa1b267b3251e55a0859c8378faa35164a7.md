## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Santiago
at each end (AP and repeater) enter web administration and run "Site 
Survey" or "Active clients" "Client table", whatever, to see signal 
strenght, noise level, speed between linked radios and possible conflict 
with foreign signal at same or close channel. Look for client in list 
which represents your other radio.
If no other signal at same channel but signal is poor, then definetly 
you need better antennas. At least at one side.
If noise level is showed separately  and is high and at same time signal 
is high, resulting speed will also be low. Again, better antenna.
Better antenna means, not only more gain but also more directivity.

Also check wireles quality between client and repeater.

By the way, what is the distance between two antennas? Are they at same 
level from ground (assuming you have horizontal ground) . If there is a 
hill or high bulding and one antenna is much higher then other you 
should consider that elevation with antennas vertical plane diagrams.

Just to get an idea, here are some of my home made and comercial 
antennas in action:
