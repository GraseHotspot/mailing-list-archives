I should also note, that after this release I'm planning for more 
frequent but smaller releases. This release has been way too long in the 
coming, with some big fixes that haven't been released for 6 months. 
What this will probably mean is that I'll do a few minor point releases 
(3.7.7.x) to the dev repo, and then a point release (3.7.x) to the 
stable repo. "Major" release won't really happen, although if something 
major changes, then I might make it a major release. Alternatively, when 
all the features I feel like putting in the major release are done, I'll 
release the 3.x release, however it won't have many changes from it's 
point release, just the the version number has gone major.

I do know that the risk is for many people that they have Grase in 
production and a minor release will break something, however it's 
probably better for lots of minor release and small breakage, than every 
6 months a major release that potentially breaks a few things because we 
haven't had the minor things tested by enough people.

At the end of the day, I need the community to be testing minor 
releases, as the places I'm running Grase are not a good sample of all 
the places the community are running it. For example, I only do time 
tracking at one location, not data, so some of the data tracking 
features get less testing than the time tracking (and visa versa)
