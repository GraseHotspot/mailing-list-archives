> Hi Drezen,

the distance between the AP is approx 60 meters, signal strength of the one
in question is 39%, and no interference that i know of, except from the wds
themselves. which need same channel anyway? or at least that's what i read.
noise level is -92 signal is -62 tx and rx rate are not available, I guess
because is a broadcom chip?.. Ground is not horizontal, neither are at the
same level. However, i was asking because when checking speed direcctly
with computer i can get up to 20mbps, and sometimes slower is 15mbps,
however, w/ wds, which i would expect from 7 to 10mbps, or at lowest 5, it
always go down to 3mbps. that's why i ws wondering if something was wrong..
Hope that info helps
Thanks
Santiago
