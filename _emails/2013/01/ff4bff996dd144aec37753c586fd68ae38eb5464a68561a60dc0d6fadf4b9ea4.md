{% raw  %}Hi Santiago
I think that we shouldn't use this discussion channel for wifi topics. 
This problem has nothing with grase itself. There are tons of topics and 
forums for wifi problems out there.
Send me an email directly dr***n@radez.hr

39% is rather low for link. We should have that link working as best as 
possible.
60meters is not that far.

Your other measurement signal-62 and noise -92 are much better. Assume 
that this is read from PC which is connected over repeater.
