## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim, 

Just wondering if there is any demand for a splash page only type login. 
I noticed issue 11 in trac http://trac.grasehotspot.org/ticket/11

In fact, I'd love to be able to switch a single Grase Hotspot between the two modes. 

ie. Have it setup for paid tickets most of the time but on occasions (when large groups book the site) we charge the system to allow access to anyone without the need to obtain a username/password prior.

That way for small groups they can pay individually but corporate groups can pay such that their guests can simply accept the terms and proceed. 


Regards Dave
