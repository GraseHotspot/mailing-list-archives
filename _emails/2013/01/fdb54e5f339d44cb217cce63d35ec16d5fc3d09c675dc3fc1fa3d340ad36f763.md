The way WDS works, you'll always lose bandwidth.
See http://www.keenansystems.com/newug/bblog/?postid=17.
"Because you are repeating the wireless signal with only one radio on 
one channel Each WDS link cuts the available bandwidth in 1/2 and adds a 
small amount of latency."

Thats why the best way to do this is multiple access points connected to 
a switch via ethernet wires, and have them all on the same SSID but 
different channels. Roaming won't work as well as WDS, a client will 
hang on to an AP until it can no longer connect to it, even if there is 
a stronger one near it, so you can actually put the AP's further apart 
than with WDS and it'll work well.
