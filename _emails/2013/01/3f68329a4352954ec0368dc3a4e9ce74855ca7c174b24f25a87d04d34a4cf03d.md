## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi all,

I have recently started using Grase HotSpot, and am impressed. I have swapped over from a closed source HotSpot as I need to make some customisations.

The main change I want to make first off is to customise the DHCP. Using dhcpd I can specify certain IP groups (my wording is probably a little off as I have not done this in years) and apply those groups to different MAC addresses. My understanding is that Grase uses Chilli to do the DHCP. I can find no instructions anywhere on how to change the DHCP settings in CoovaChilli or ChilliSpot.

What I am wanting in more detail:
Certain computers need specific network details and are listed by MAC address. I am NOT referring to having a computer login as is already working.
Default DHCP details are handed out to any computer that is not specified by MAC address. Eg 10.1.0.101/255.0.0.0 gw 10.1.0.1
If a computer has its MAC address specified then it is given an IP address as usual, netmask as usual, but a different gateway. Eg 10.1.0.101/255.0.0.0 gw 10.1.0.2

Thanking you in advance...
