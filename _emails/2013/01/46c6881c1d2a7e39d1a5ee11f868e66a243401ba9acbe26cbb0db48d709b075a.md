## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}It has been a few years since I last created the needed tables, so I will have to work them out again. If putting the rules in the up.sh file will constantly apply them then I will try that. I do not quite follow what you mean about the tun0 interface, but I am sure that I can find out.

I will give this a try and let you know how I go. If you have any relevant flashes of brilliance in the meantime feel free to let me know. :-)
