## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thanks Tim      for the informationI was aware of cutting in half but not
down to only 3 specially with only one wds .although it could be a
distance   or configuration problem I just can't figure out what. Also
what  can I check for the server not receiving full 35 mbps
Thanks
Santiago
