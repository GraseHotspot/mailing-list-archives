Just chilli_query list is what you probably want. Have a look on the 
coova chilli website for more details. A google should find all the 
information. Most of the 0/0 style numbers are different limits (with 0 
being no limit applied) with the limit and it's counter both visible. 
You'll probably find that the 0/600 is idle timeout, and if the first 
number in that pair hits 600, it'll disconnect as it's timed out.
