## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi All, I'm wondering if anyone had experience sae problem with wds being
slow. I have dd-wrt installed and direct conection works somehow great.. at
least i get about 20mbps. HOwever, I did test speed on the server directly
connected and it gives me only 20mbps, i have 35mbps. and with a direct
cable conection to the internet or router trhough internet works fine.
Wondering if it is something on the grase system or it could just be my
network card. I know is not the cable because i tested with same cable on a
different computer and goes to 35mbps.
On the WDS Part, the secondary router, does not go faster than 3mbps, could
it be that distance between routers is affecting the speed at which the
signal is received? or something i got wrong? although at the same distance
my computer receives 14mbps over wireless.. any help is appreciated.

thanks
Santiago
