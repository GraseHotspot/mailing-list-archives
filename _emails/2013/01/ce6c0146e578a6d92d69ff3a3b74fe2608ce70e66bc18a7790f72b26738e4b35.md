## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}For Some reason i think im' getting returns on my emails.

What I need to know if I should by another extender as WDS or router i need
extra extension i'm thinking of buying the same one encore extender for wds
since i already know and is less time consuming and i need the item fast.
However, any opinions welcome. Also, a good idea for the grase is to put an
option for some kind of special promotion, for example, let the customer
try extra bandwidth for few days, and after that, will return to normal
speed.
Regards
Santiago
