You probably don't want VoIP adapters behind a captive portal system. 
Usually it'll need port forwarding, and unless the Grase server has a 
public ip, you'd need port forwarding on the upstream router as well. 
Ideally, get your VoIP adapter as "close" to the internet as possible, 
ideally not behind NAT.

This is just due to the way VoIP works with ports, which doesn't work 
well behind NAT devices.

On my home satellite internet, we are "double natted" and can't do 
anything about it, which makes VoIP basically impossible to run. :(
