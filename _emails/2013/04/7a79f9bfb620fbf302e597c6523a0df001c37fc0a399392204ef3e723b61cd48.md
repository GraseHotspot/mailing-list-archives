## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hi Erik

Any luck yet?

First thing would be to go into the settings pages, make sure the 
WAN/LAN settings are correct, and hit save again. Also check the DNS 
settings are correct.

It may be that Squid has failed for some reason, so can you check that 
ping works, and that accessing a website via it's ip address (try for 
example 'curl 66.228.55.48' which should give you a message about Nginx) 
works.
