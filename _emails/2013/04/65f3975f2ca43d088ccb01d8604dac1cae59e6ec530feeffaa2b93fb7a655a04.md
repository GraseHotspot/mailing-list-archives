{% raw  %}Hi peter,

I have been looking for solution for squid3 redirection quite sometimes and
hoping somebody would found a solution.  I really need squid to work very
bad.. especially the caching features.  Well, after much time spent
searching for ways to configure squid3 and experimenting with many
configurations I finally manage to make squid3 to work as usual in Grase
3.7.7.6.  The process is quite simple,

1. Edit the file in /etc/chilli/ipup.sh

2. Comment by using "#" symbol on the left side of the "ipt" word to both
previous command which is shown below to disable it.

#ipt -I PREROUTING -t mangle -p tcp -s $NET/$MASK -d $ADDR --dport 3128 -j
DROP

then add the below command

ipt -I PREROUTING -t mangle -p tcp -d $ADDR --dport 3128 -j DROP

3. later, do the same with the below command

#ipt -I PREROUTING -t nat -i $TUNTAP -p tcp -s $NET/$MASK -d ! $ADDR
--dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to 3128

then add the below command

ipt -I PREROUTING -t nat -i $TUNTAP -p tcp  --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to 3128

4. Save

5. Restart chilli by typing "sudo service chilli restart" in terminal and
viola.. squid logs and caching works! Plus, all direct connection to the
squid server such as 10.1.0.1:3128 will still be dropped.

P/s: Please make sure you understand what you are doing, and have backups.
I don't know whether it will work on your system, but it did in mine and I
am loving GRASE Hotspot.

regards,
darnalis
