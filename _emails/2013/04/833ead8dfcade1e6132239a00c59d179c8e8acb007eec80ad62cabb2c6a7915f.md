## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hey!

My hotspot server died due to hardware problems, so i bought some new
hardware. (total new machine with some more speed).
Tried to install GraseHotspot on debian 7.1 at first. But got some problems
in the installer with chilli.

So i figured out to install latest ubuntu. Did install Grase, dumped in the
database from my sql-backup.
The sign in portal shows up. I Enter username and password. The computers
trying to connect get ip and dns.

The problem is just that. It doesnt work to use domainnames when surfing.
Did test a ping domainname ip, didnt get respons, figured out that pinging
the same adress (resolved ip) from a domain, Works.

So i need help solving this problem, cause, to not be able to surf with
domainname. Is a pretty ugly case.



Let me know if there is some information (like files) you need to have info
from.
