Basically it's because any users you create in a group without expiries, 
will exist forever unless you manually delete them. Most Hotspot setups 
are "casual" users and having old accounts around "forever" is not a 
desirable thing.
Even the argument for "staff" being "forever" users is a little void, as 
staff don't exist forever ether. I often set staff to say a year, and 
make sure I update them before they expire (I think we still need an 
"extend expiry" button).
