I was unaware that the bug/feature tracker was down. 
(http://trac.grasehotspot.org) I've done some updates to it tonight, as 
well as putting a voting plugin in place. Hopefully if you are logged in 
(OpenID login on far right) then you should be able to up and down vote 
tickets.

Feel free to start voting!

As for bounties, not sure the best way to do this at the moment, if you 
are interested in offering a bounty, for now just leave a comment on the 
ticket, and ensure your details are correct in your profile. I'll work 
out bounties when someone is interested in them.

Tim
