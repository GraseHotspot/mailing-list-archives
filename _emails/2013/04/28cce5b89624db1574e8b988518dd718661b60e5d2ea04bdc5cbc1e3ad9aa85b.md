Hi Glyn

Being a normal "server", you can configure the WAN however you require. 
Under debian it's a matter of editing the /etc/network/interfaces file, 
finding the correct ethX entry that is set to DHCP and set it to static 
and set it's options. http://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration should 
assist.

It sounds like your routers DHCP lease time might be rather low too, 
which could cause problems with leases expiring. Ether way, static 
sounds like the way to go. As long as you've set the DNS servers 
correctly in the Grase admin section, you shouldn't need to worry about 
setting DNS to point to the router ether, just do the ip address.
