Sorry Tim I missed that extra rule that I should try for squid could you send that out again tried searching but could not see it..
I see many other shave the same squid issue with the latest release

About the keep alive we have many mobile users complaining that they needed to logon many times during the day.
I tried quite some settings but still no go.
Yesterday I put the idle timeout to 0 see what happens hi...
I also made a ping sweeper every 5 minutes to keep devices alive on the 10.1.0.0 network.

Hi Paul.
I'll have another look at squid. Did you try that firewall rule?

I'm not sure what an Idle timeout of 0 will do. I would expect it to kick you off rather quickly. Default idletime is 300 I think, which is 5 minutes. If you increase it do your users still timeout?

Hello,

Is there already news about the logging issue (squid not working and request are going direct) see my earlier mails...

Another issue we are seeing is that users need to revalidate every x minutes if there is no stream of data.
Should 'Standard Session idle Time-out' be 0?
Tried different settings but no good results until yet...?
