## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I don't know if this is advisable or recommended, but I have a problem with the ADSL router my customer is using - they are currently re-booting it quite regularly, and every time they do that the GRASE server falls off the network in that it loses its IP address that should be handed out by the router.  We end up with a functioning hotspot with no internet connectivity.  Usually when this is that case I have had to ssh to the GRASE server from the LAN and restart it (I realise I may be able to just restart the network services, but run the risk of losing my only connection to the server as it is not physically accessible to me most of the time.

I think I could configure a static IP address outside of the dhcp range of the router, we have already done that for the win 7 clients in the office as they were bringing down the dhcp service on the router, then when the router gets restarted there is no effect on the hostspot.  If that is not recommended what about scheduling  a cron job to restart the WAN interface every few hours so that if it loses its address again it will repair when the interface restarts.

regards
