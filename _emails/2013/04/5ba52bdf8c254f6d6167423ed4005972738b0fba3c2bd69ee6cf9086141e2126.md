Hi Juvenal.

I don't really understand your email or what you are asking. Yes, we 
leave it up to the individual running Grase to determin what DNS server 
that want to use, and if they are allowed to use the OpenDNS family 
filter that is set by default. I have continued to ask OpenDNS for 
permission to include the Family Filter ip's by default, and never 
gotten a single reply from them.

I do intend to provide another way for filtering in the future, however 
for now the most reliable way is OpenDNS family filter. You can also 
setup local filtering in Squid or Dansguardian.

Tim
