## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}As far as I can tell I got an repeater to work OK - although the system will be going back on site tomorrow so that will prove it.

I was already using a TP Link access point, configured with a static address 10.1.0.253. So I bought another one just the same and followed the instructions for enabling a repeater - basically from the AP GUI it would scan the available networks then I just selected my existing hotspot.  It could be done manually with just the SSID and the MAC of the AP. I did set the IP of the repeater to 10.1.0.252 just so I could connect it to the existing lan to manage in future.

Once working I tested it by taking the new ap to the garage and watched the signal strength go down on my iPad, then turned on the repeater and after 30 secs full signal strength and I could walk out of range of the original AP.

I think the trick is getting the hardware to play together which is why I used identical devices.

Hi Tim,

i use a WRT54GL with DD-WRT (AP mode, no encryption, IP: 10.1.0.2 / 255.255.255.0, GW+DNS 10.1.0.1, DHCP of and forward to 10.1.0.1) directly connected to squid.
Client WLAN connection to the WRT54GL works fine.

The repeater is an edimax EW-7438RPn (IP: 10.1.0.8 / 255.255.255.0, GW: 10.1.0.1)
http://www.edimax.us/html/english/products/EW-7438RPn.htm

the repeater is connected to wrt54gl and I got a dhcp lease from grase server.
I cannot ping the grase server and got timeout.

Lars

Hi Lars

Firstly, what equipment are you using?

Currently your access points and repeaters must only be doing Layer 2 routing. Layer 3 should be left to the hotspot. This means you shouldn't need DHCP relays, and your access points and repeaters IP's shouldn't be on the grase network (mostly for security, but also so they don't interfer with a client). They should be setup as "ethernet bridges", with all Layer 3 (IP addresses and such) handled by grase.

The best way to think of it, is they should be setup transparently like an ethernet switch. You don't know how many ethernet switches are between you and a server, just how many routers. If you can tell how many wireless devices are between you and the server (due to IP routing instead of Ethernet routing) then they are setup wrong.

Let us know what model equipment you have, and the settings in them.

I´m testing grase since some weeks and all works fine.
I´ve found some help for the squid logging problem in the mailing list but now i´ve a problem to connect a repeater.

This is my configuration:
Grase Server:
- IP 10.1.0.1 / 255.255.255.0
- DHCPStart 10
- DHCPend 250

WRT54GL AccessPoint-1
- IP 10.1.0.2 / 255.255.255.0
- GW / DNS: 10.1.0.1
- DHCP forwarder: 10.1.0.1
- no encryption

WRT54GL AccessPoint-2:
- IP 10.1.0.3 / 255.255.255.0
- GW / DNS: 10.1.0.1
- DHCP forwarder: 10.1.0.1
- no encryption

Now I want to connect a repeater to AccessPoint-2.

Repeater-1:
- 10.1.0.8 / 255.255.255.0
- GW: 10.1.0.1
- no encryption

Repeater-1 is connected to AccessPoint-2, dhcp works fine, but I can´t reach the grase server / internet
If I ping the grase server 10.1.0.1 I get a timeout. Ping to Accesspoint-1 and Accesspoint-2 works fine.

Please give me a hint what i´m doing wrong.

Thx

Lars
