## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hallo ALL

 

I still have the problem that squid isn't logging traffic from customers.

Did all the suggestions other members writhe on this list but nothing seems
to help.

If I look to all the emails that are written over this subject nobody has a
clear answer yet.

I mean it in this way that no one yet gifs feedback that this was the
solution for him or her.

For me it's a hot item because I live in an apartment building where people
move in and out by the month.

We had already problems with the police because someone uses the internet
for drugs related items.

 

I am very happy with Grase and I provide this at low cost for the people in
the building and I don't want to get problems.

Tim White did a great job creating this software and it's very stable too so
I hope that I can enjoy it a long time.( if the problem is solved)

 

I hope someone of u can help me.

 

I would be very grateful

 

Thanks in advanced.

 

Peter
