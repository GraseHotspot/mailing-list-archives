## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello All

 

I have the same problem as Jarod wrote in his email of 06-04-2013

But I see no answer to his and mine problem yet.

That's why I bring this problem a second time to everybody's attention.

 

All is working well except for Squid.

The access.log (/var/log/squid3/access.log) from squid is empty and the
session monitoring in the Admin interface only show total traffic in KiB.

Is this happening because I give my customers unlimited up en download for 1
month?

Or is there another reason?

Can somebody explain why this is happening?   

Thanks' in advance.

Peter Louman
