Hi Pablo

You shouldn't need any of those settings in the radgroupreply table. 
What you are saying in the radgroupreply is that for any user in the 
static group, firstly they are connecting via PPP (which they aren't), 
secondly that they are a Framed-User, which they probably are but that's 
not something we need to set, and lastly you give them the ip 
address.... All users in the group, get that ip address, which is wrong.

What you have in the radreply table is correct though, and should be 
working. It will only work with Machine accounts though, (which will 
have a corresponding password in the radcheck table as well) as the 
Framed-IP-Address can only be honour at Mac Authentication time by coova 
chilli, as once a client has a DHCP lease, we can't then change their ip 
address.

When I can, I'll try it myself and see, but just that radreply line 
should be what you need, as long as there is already a machine account 
for that MAC address.
