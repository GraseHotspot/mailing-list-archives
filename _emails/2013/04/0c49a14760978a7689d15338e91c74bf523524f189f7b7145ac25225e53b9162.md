Hi Pablo.

You'd need to reset all the users usage data, which would reset their
limits as well.

I guess a better question would be to why you need to reset it? There is
currently some work (unreleased but I can probably show you a demo) on the
reports, that allows you to filter the reports, and select time periods. If
you are really just interested in getting report data about a particular
person or month, this will help you.

If it's because you did lots of testing and now just want the real data in
it, and you used some test users, it might be easy enough to just delete
the test users usage data?
