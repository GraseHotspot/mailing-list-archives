I've never had to play with pppoe, so I'm no help sorry. I believe it 
should be fairly similar as to a modem.

This is one place that Grase isn't as intuitive as it should be. 
/etc/network/interfaces will control some of what the local machine 
uses. However, due to how Grase is setup, you need to change the DNS 
servers (the ones you listed above are the OpenDNS ones) in the Grase 
admin section to point to your upstream DNS servers. Then, the Grase 
server and all the clients point to the Grase Server, which will use 
those listed upstream DNS servers.

If you can ping the websites, then it's not a DNS issue and is probably 
a routing issue. Check you have the correct WAN and LAN interfaces 
selected in the Admin section and hit save, then reboot.
