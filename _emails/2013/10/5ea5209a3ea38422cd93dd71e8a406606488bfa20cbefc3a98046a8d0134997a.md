## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Only way to disable/enable users as I know is field "Account Lock 
Reason" at each particular user edit page. If field is empty , user is 
active (if other accounting credentials like time or data are not 
expired ). If you enter anything in that field, user will be 
deactivated. If you wish to activate that user again, clean up that field.
Don't know how this behave if user is connected and you wish to deactive 
him/her. Probably connection will last untill user disconnects itself. 
Then will be no able to connect again. Just my guess.

Not clear to me how you would use IP addresses for users. If you have 
plan to have static IP clients and name users with IP address, it is 
generally possible with adjusting DHCP from Grase. Don't see why bother 
with that. You can use mac addresses instead.
Hope this help
