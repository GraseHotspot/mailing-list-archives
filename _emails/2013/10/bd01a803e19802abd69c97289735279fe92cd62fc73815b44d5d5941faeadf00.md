## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Unless there is a bug, it should be showing all current walled sites on
that page.
Are you adding sites and then they are disappearing? Maybe they aren't
adding correctly, or you have a javascript bug.

You should be able to see the complete list of current walled sites, and
can add and delete them.
