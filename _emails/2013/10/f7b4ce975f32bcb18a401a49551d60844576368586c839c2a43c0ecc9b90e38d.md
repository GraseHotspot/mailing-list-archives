## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Sorry I should have posted mac addresses and not IP addresses:

1) I would like to stop or filter out a  group of mac addresses from getting online but be able to give them access again when I want them to do research.

I would like to be able to turn their internet connection on and off from the admin interface?



2) Also is there a way to give mac addresses a friendly name that can be seen easily from the admin interface page,

I always find if hard to work out who is who just by the mac address?
