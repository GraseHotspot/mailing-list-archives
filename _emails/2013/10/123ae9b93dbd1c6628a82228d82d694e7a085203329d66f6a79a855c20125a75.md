## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Assuming each client does get a unique IP address from Grase, does it also
present to the network a unique MAC address? We rely on MAC addresses to
identify clients, so if it's 100 unique IP addresses but all appearing as a
single MAC, then it won't work.

Also, check that the IP's aren't being NATted before Grase.
