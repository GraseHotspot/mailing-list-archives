{% raw  %}Thanks for all the info and help guys.


To give all the users individual logins would be great but one problem I have at the moment is the organisation want us to use one username and one password for the general public to access the internet (we are an art gallery). This is so we do not have to hand out usernames and passwords and do tech suport and so on. The problem I am having is some of my student  who only come here for training have got hold of this login information and have been going onto the internet instead of doing their work. This is why I was trying to block and unblock access by using MAC addresses as this would only affect my training room laptops. I guess I need to find a better or easier way to do this.

What is the procedure to restart coova chilli remotely from admin and without rebooting the grase machine?
When coova chilli is restarting will this be a long process or very quick and will it delay other users from internet access as it restarts?
