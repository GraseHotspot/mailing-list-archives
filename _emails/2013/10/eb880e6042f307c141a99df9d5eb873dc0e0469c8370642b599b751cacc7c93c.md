## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I had intended to make the ticket printing customisable. However, I've not
had the time to do this, and realised the complexity of this. (You can
manually edit the pdf printing code for a temporary solution).

The other reason it went down in the priority list, is some of the printing
of tickets that was required was too complex for anything I could get the
library to do. Hence I wrote the CSV export, and then have my own custom
scripts to turn that into a printed product. I have a script that would
take a specially formatted SVG file as input, and the CSV file, and spit
out pages of tickets with "Mail Merge" field replaced with ticket
information. This gave me heaps of flexability in my printing and a much
better result that the PDF library would give me for the same amount of
work. Potentially I'll publish those scripts to assist others in the near
future.
