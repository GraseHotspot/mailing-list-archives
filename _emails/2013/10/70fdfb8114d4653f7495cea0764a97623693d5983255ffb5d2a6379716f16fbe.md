## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Daz,

Oh, I see your situation now. It looks like your real problem is with your
organization's policy. It seems to defeat the purpose of having a captive
portal.

If you can't change that policy and its only a few offending students to
deal with, you could ssh into the Grase server and, once you find out  the
relevent mac addresses, entering the following command will logout the
listed devices every 10 seconds until you hit ctll+C in the console.

while :; do echo 'Hit CTRL+C to stop blocking 00-1F-29-XX-XX-XX and
00-1F-30-XX-XX-XX ';chilli_query logout 00-1F-29-XX-XX-XX  ;chilli_query
logout 00-1F-30-XX-XX-XX; sleep 10; done

Regards,

Bob
