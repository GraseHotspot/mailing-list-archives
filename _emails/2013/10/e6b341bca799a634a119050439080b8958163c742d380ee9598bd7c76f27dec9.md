{% raw  %}Hi Darren
I am not fully qualified for right answer. Just some remarks.
For what you are looking for, you should ask Tim to program such 
functionality for you.
Using MAC addresses is not convenient in that case how I can see. This 
is cpecial case how radius working. So, usernames should be more 
appropriate way with additional programing.
In real world problems like yours are solved by proxy servers and users 
which are declared in LDAP directory or txt file optionaly. Using proxy 
it is possble to block or allow users or even MAC addrs. Still not easy 
to recognize who is who. User-way is better.
In Grase there is one proxy (Squid) which is part of package. However, 
Tim is only who can give best advice or solution.

I don't know exactly how do you using Grase, but there is an option to 
use iPCop (obsollete) or similar
SmoothWall gateway instead of Grase. Both has posibility to control the 
users at your way.
Rgds.
