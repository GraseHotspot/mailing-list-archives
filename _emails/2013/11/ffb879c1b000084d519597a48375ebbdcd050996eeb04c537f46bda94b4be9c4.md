## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi, 

Just wondering if other have had issues with computer accounts not working reliably and if there is anything I can do to help. 

I have a Grase server with unifi access points and a unifi server behind it. 
I want the unifi server (desktop running XP) to have permanent access to the internet. 

I have added the mac address to the computer account (all caps) and initially it kept getting the grade login page. 
Then it did connect through correctly for a few days and now its gone pack to just hitting the grase login page again. 

Any ideas?





{% endraw %}
