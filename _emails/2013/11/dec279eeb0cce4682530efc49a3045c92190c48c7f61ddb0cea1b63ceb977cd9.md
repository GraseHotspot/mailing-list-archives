## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi,

I have been using your excellent software for a few months now and its been
good ever since.

I notice that with the walled garden allowed domains, people without a
ticket will not be monitored for bandwidth and time usage which is what I
want. The only change I would like though is for all to have to enter a
valid ticket but not be monitored for bandwidth.

The idea here is to offer free local websites (hosted from within our
network) but only charge for offshore sites which we get charged for. The
only twist is that they will have to have a valid ticket to access the free
local websites.

I would be grateful if this could be done.

Kind regards,

Karotu
