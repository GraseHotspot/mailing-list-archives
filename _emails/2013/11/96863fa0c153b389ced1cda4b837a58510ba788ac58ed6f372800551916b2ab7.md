You should set it as AP and disable WAN port. You should use router's 
LAN port to connect to Grase . I don't know if that router is possible 
to set in this application at all.
You don't need to set up any address other then one already there but 
you will be not able to access to web interface of it. Or you can set 
10.1.0.2 /255.255.255.0

DHCP server must be off. DHCP service is provided by Grase.

After installing Grase, it will configure second interface itself. That 
interface is controlled by Chilli part of Grase and should set address 
10.1.0.1 . Here you are connecting your client network by mean of simple 
one wirelles AP or Switch and then multiple wirelles APs or even wired 
clients.
What do you mean by WAP?
Maybe you mean WEP as encription method AP. WEP is obsolete and 
everybody should use WPA WPA2 . However it is absolute not practical in 
this application. Grase doesn't have option to control WPA. I am not 
sure if any encription on WiFi side will disrupt login procedure with 
Grase.
Leave it "open" .

I think that you didn't read manual carefully.
Wish you luck
