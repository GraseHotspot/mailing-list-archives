Interesting.

One of the keys is just a key, the other is a unique key. Having both won't hurt. I believe what must have happened is initially just the key was there, but then I wanted the unique constraint, and so added it. I don't think it should have ever had both keys, but it's not hurting it.

I believe it's been in the database code since the first BZR commit, so it dates back a long way.
