## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Without seeing more information, it's a bit hard to say.

Firstly, make sure that your AP isn't using an IP in the same subnet as the
Grase server. Otherwise it could conflict. If it's a proper AP it'll be
doing Layer 2 routing anyway, and so it's IP address can be on another
subnet without causing problems.

Then check you get an ip address from the grase server.

Check that you can resolve domain names from a client. (Try pinging
google.com and seeing what ip address it gets).

Also check you can ping the Grase server.
