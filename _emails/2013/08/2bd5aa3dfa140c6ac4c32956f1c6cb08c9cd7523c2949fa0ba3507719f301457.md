## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}First, thanks for this great project! Access for wireless devices works
well with Grase, from the captive portal down to the accounting features.

We are also serving internet access to wired workstations using NComputing
thin clients. While the captive portal works for any client in a cluster,
we notice that Grase seems to regard the cluster as one PC, thus giving
access to the other clients in that cluster using the first authenticated
account. Our hosts are a mix of WinXP and Win2003.

Has anyone managed to setup Grase in such a way that it can accurately
detect each client session as a separate session? Each thin client gets a
unique IP address, by the way.

Any help will be most appreciated. Thanks!
{% endraw %}
