## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

FYI, I changed the DHCP start value through the web interface, expecting it to refresh within the hour. After leaving it all weekend though the change had not taken effect and we were getting IP address conflicts.

I ssh'd into the GRASE server and restarted CoovaChilli and all is good now.

Thanks for making such great software.
