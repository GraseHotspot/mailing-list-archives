{% raw  %}Hi all,
I have been using grase hotspot for a while on my desktop computer. Of late i sold the desktop in order to get a new laptop dell with 500GB HDD and 4GB RAM duo processor.

i installed ubuntu desktop 12.10 and also installed grase successfully. i can even log in to the grase admin section from another computer within the grase LAN. the only problem is that when trying to access any web address there is no redirection to the login screen.
can someone help me out on how i should configure it.

this is my setup;

1.Grase hotspot will lan on my laptop LAN  adapter which is only one (eth0) which i have connected  to a switch and my access point with dhcp disabled also connected on the switch and on same ip subnet as grase.(All set done perfectly)
2.The laptop connects to my ISP through the wireless WLAN adapter (wlan0) which works ok.

My problem
how should i configure grase so that it can work and redirect to login page when a user on the LAN of grase browses any website?
