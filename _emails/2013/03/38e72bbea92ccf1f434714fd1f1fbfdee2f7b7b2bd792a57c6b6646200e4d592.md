Maybe some more details as to how it is setup.

In a normal Grase setup, Grase handles the DHCP for the network. It 
sounds to me as if you have the Grase server (say 10.1.0.1) at Site A, 
and it's the default gateway for the Site A network, and handles DHCP 
for the Site A network? Then you have a router at Site A that is somehow 
connected to Site B (assuming a PTP like?). Site B doesn't have an 
"internet" connection, just the connection to Router A at Site A.

What I don't get about this setup, which probably means I misunderstood 
your setup, is how do the Site A client computers know how to connect to 
the Site B client computers. Unless they all have static routes in them 
pointing them to the 10.1.0.254 router for 10.1.1.0, they'll be trying 
to use 10.1.0.1 as the route for all unknown networks. Adding static 
routes to lots of computers is silly and annoying.


Maybe a digram of how it's all connected, and what routes are in place 
(including default routes) and what the links are, would help. It also 
sounds like you probably need Grase setup in Layer 3 routing, not Layer 
2, and so it wouldn't be handling DHCP, just captive portal.
