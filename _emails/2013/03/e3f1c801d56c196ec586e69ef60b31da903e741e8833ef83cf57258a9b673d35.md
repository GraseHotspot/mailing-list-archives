 Priority:  major          |  Milestone:  3.9

 (n.b. http://grasehotspot.org/contact/ is broken and returns an HTTP 405
 when you attempt to submit the form)

 I happened across a request in one of our webserver logs from a Nokia
 smartphone which appears to be using hotspot running GRASE. It appears
 that the hotspot leaks the client MAC address in the HTTP referrer
 information:

 "http://10.1.0.1/grase/uam/hotspot?res=notyet&uamip=10.1.0.1&uamport=3990&challenge=ELIDED&called=ELIDED&mac=ELIDED&ip=10.1.1.126&nasid=nas01&sessionid=ELIDED&userurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bing.com%2f"

 I don't know if your current version does this but if so, it'd be a very
 good idea to run everything through a redirect script which can ensure
 that nothing confidential is leaked to third-party websites, particularly
 since MAC addresses are increasingly sensitive now that most cell phones
 have them.
