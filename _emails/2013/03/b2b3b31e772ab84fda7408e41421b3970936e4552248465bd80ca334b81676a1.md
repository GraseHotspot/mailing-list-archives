## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I have bought myself a cool looking gadget called DreamPlug thinking that it would be great to put Grase on in the Internet Caf√© we are opening. My experience, although enjoyable, has not achieved the desired result.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but there appears to be no way of getting Grase running on this platform without building from source, which I do not have enough time for at the moment.

The problem is that Ubuntu 10.04 does not support Arm, and I have upgraded Debian Lenny to Squeeze (I think I have anyway). Now I find that there seems to be no .deb of any Grase components that are made for Arm processors.

Am I right or can someone point me to something I am missing that will get this brilliant software (I am using it at home on an old PC) working on the DreamPlug?

Thanks in advance...
