## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hi All

I'm guessing as no-one's been able to reply to me on this one that it's not possible.  I've been doing some extensive playing around and whilst my findings are rather basic, I'm letting people know in case it helps someone else.  Because of this problem where Grase can only support one internal subnet, Grase isn't scalable for me, so I've had to reject it in favour of a different product, namely untangle.  

Untangle has two modes, either NAT or Transparent.  In NAT mode, it exhibits exactly the same problem that Grase does, even though the routing is easily configurable in Untangle and everything is most definitely set up correctly.  However, in transparent mode, it works!  So I'm guessing it's more of a problem to do with the server NATting between the two interfaces regardless of the server.  Grase's webpages do seem to suggest something about working in transparent mode but, probably due to my lack of experience with Linux, it doesn't mean much to me.

If anyone else has found a way of running Grase in transparent mode that a noob like me can understand, I'd really love to hear from you, especially as Grase offers functionality that Untangle makes you pay through the nose for.  As I work for a non-profit organisation, these are just facilities I'll have to do without.

All the best
Steve

    sounds to me as if you have the Grase server (say 10.1.0.1) at Site
    A, and it's the default gateway for the Site A network, and handles
    DHCP for the Site A network? Then you have a router at Site A that
    is somehow connected to Site B (assuming a PTP like?). Site B
    doesn't have an "internet" connection, just the connection to Router
    A at Site A.

>What I don't get about this setup, which probably means I
    misunderstood your setup, is how do the Site A client computers know
    how to connect to the Site B client computers. Unless they all have
    static routes in them pointing them to the 10.1.0.254 router for
    10.1.1.0, they'll be trying to use 10.1.0.1 as the route for all
    unknown networks. Adding static routes to lots of computers is silly
    and annoying.

    It also sounds like you probably need Grase setup in Layer 3
    routing, not Layer 2, and so it wouldn't be handling DHCP, just
    captive portal.
