## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hey Paul.

Thanks for all this good debug info. Hopefully you've realised that 
nothing should have changed regarding the squid logs. I did recently try 
testing my installs, however they are still logging, making it hard to 
work out what's different.

Can you also get me the iptables output for the nat and mangle tables. 
These are the ones that actually redirect to squid.

iptables -L -t nat
iptables -L -t mangle

Also, what's your kernel version, and your iptables version?
iptables -V
uname -a

> Ps  What are these ports as they are not active on tcp:
> tcp dpt:4990
> tcp dpt:3990

These ports are used by Coova Chilli, the are the ports the web 
interface communicates over to login and get status details and such. 
They should be active, although I'm not sure how you are trying to see 
if they are active.

Tim
p.s. I'm away all weekend, so it'll be a few days before I can look at 
the debug info and compare to a working setup
