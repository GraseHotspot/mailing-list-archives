This should already work in the squid logs. Unfortunately this only 
audits the http traffic, and not https or bittorrent or anything else 
like that. You probably want to research what is needed to be an ISP in 
your country to get a better idea of the auditing they are required to 
do. Laws vary from country to country. Some countries it's good enough 
to say that you resell your internet and so you can't track it down to 
an individual user.
