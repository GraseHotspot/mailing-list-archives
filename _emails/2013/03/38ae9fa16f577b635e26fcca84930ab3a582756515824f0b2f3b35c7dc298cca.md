{% raw  %}Hai Drazen,

I have no logging whatsoever from the hotspot anymore. Also the show all sessions will not show historic activities. It only show the amount of total data. (that's in the sql)
On the older version I ran some stats tools using the access.log file from squid. It is in /var/log/squid3/access.log (which now stays empty)
But it would be good to know if others also simply can turn of squid without any effect (I saw another post which sounds like the same issue).
Maybe you could test it for me by simply entering 'service squid3 stop' on your hotspot and if any issue rise simply start it again with 'service squid3 start' on my site squid is simply not being used with Grase at the time (since 3.7.7.6) 
It's now just with IP forward. If I disable ipforward than the hotspot stops redirecting requests. You can test that with:

cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
if it says 1 its being enabled if 0 its disabled I am sure it would say 1

If you do:

'echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward' you would see after a few seconds the hotspot stops. 
Doing 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward' will enabled it again and the hotspot works again after a few seconds

Pity as I liked squid in between (also for scanning and anti adds)

Hi Paul,
Timothy wrote before about new way of session log displaying and filtering.
Default view of session page is showing only active ones in new version. 
If no active conns.  at the moment , nothing is showed.
There is a switch to all session view at the top-left  edge of session 
log frame. It says "Display All Sessions"
Try that.

Well, which log file is written actually? That part I don't know because 
ever need it yet.

Rgds.

Hello,

Just stopped squid3 (service squid3 stop) and to my amazement the hotspot is not even using Squid so all traffic goes directly. (ip forwarding ??) In the old version squid was still used and produced all stats.

Is this indeed been disabled in this release or did something else happen?

Hello,

Another issues rose.. the hotspot is now running ok but the access.log from squid stays empty.
If I telnet to port 3128 from the local machine I see an entry but not from end users..

What am I missing....?
