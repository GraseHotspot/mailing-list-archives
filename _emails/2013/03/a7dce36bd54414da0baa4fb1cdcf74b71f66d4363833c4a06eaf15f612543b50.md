## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Steve,
thanks for your e-mail. I have now installed Linux for what must have been
the 15th time and it is now working. Don't ask me what was wrong before,
maybe it simply was a broken LAN card (replaced it) maybe it was just
unlucky coincidences in the autoconfig. Before, ifconfig just wouldn't show
eth1, now I have eth0 and eth1 and lo and tun0 just as you have described
it. For some reason I also have a tun1 but that doesn't seem to break
anything. So, it seems to be working for now.
Thanks for your help,
Benjamin
