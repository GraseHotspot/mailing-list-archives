## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Finally, I got Grase configured correctly (I guess so) on VMware. But one
thing I am not able to understand is that how do I access Grase admin page
on the same PC. I mean when I am connected to an always-on static ip
internet connection, it doesn't allow access to Grase admin ip. Is Grase
admin page only accessible through second NIC(LAN) connected to other
system or PC?

Thanks.
