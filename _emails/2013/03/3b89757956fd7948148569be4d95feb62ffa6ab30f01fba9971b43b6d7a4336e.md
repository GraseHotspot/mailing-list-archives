{% raw  %}Hi Steve

I only get to work on Grase in my spare time, and recently haven't had 
much spare time due to a building move at work.

 From the sounds of things, in transparent mode, you probably won't be 
getting the captive portal that grase provides? Or is Untangles 
transparent mode actually just a normal routing mode without NAT?

I believe what you want to do, probably needs Layer 3 routing on Grase, 
not layer 2. I've not had any time to implement the option for layer 3 
routing in Coova Chilli in the Grase interface. The main reason is for 
most people, they don't want complicated routing, and so Layer 2 is 
fine. For you, Layer 3 is needed. (Technically you can do what you want 
in Layer 2, with a larger ip range, and a dynip range for the first 
subnet, and a statip range for the other subnet).

Anyway, I believe what you want to do can be done in Grase, its just 
going to need a lot of working out initially as it's so not standard. 
Perhaps contact me off list with more information about the non-profit 
organisation and I can see if we can work out some cheap support so I 
can put some time into making this work?

As nice as untangle is, it does make you pay through the nose for things 
that shouldn't cost much. I have good networking knowledge and have 
studied it at Uni, it's just a matter of setting up a test environment 
to test it all.
