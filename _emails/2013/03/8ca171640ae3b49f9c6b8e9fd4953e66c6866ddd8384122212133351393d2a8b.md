{% raw  %}Hi Peter
honestly speaking I don't think this is good approach for internet-cafe. 
You want there good reliable machine with good engine under the hatch. 
Something you can scale , fix, extend and so on.
Basically, grase is a router with proxy plus radius+mysql+Apache and of 
course + coovachilli access controller. Quite a bunch of heavy services 
where good performer is desirable.
I don't believe that such toy able to handle tens clients simultaneously 
at the proper speed.
It is not unusually that such box need to have multicore CPU, tons of 
RAM and SAS disks in fast RAID configurations. Just to illustrate how 
fast it scales as number of user grow up to 100 and more. Traffic 
content is also important.

Back to your basic question. If regular Ubuntu can work, nothing extra 
related grase and ARM is necessary. (I am running one grase instance on 
ViaEPIA mini-itx board with VIA CPU at 1GHz. It is quite old assembly 
today. There is nothing then regular 32bit Ubuntu and regular grase 
components.
I don't have any experience with ARM thing. Someone else may talk here 
more qualify. I just wish to point that if standard Ubuntu work, grase 
will too. If not, any thoughts about rebuilding anything afraid are not 
good at long terms.
So my advice, go with standard hardware which is proven to work. Much 
better for business.
