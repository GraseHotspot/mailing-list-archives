## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi everybody,

I've been trying to get grase to run for a couple of days now and I always
seem to run into problems with the network hardware configuration. Since
I'm not very experienced with Linux it would be great if you could help me
out.

Since I'm testing right now I set up a machine completly with Ubuntu 12.04
LTS and during the installation it recognizes the network cards without
problems, correctly getting an IP from my router. Then I installed grase
and here it gets confusing - nothing worked. It seemed like the grase
machine was giving out IPs through the network card it was just supposed to
be client on.

So my question: If I install the server as explained on the website, what
should "ifconfig" show BEFORE the grase installation (i.e. should both eth0
and eth1 be listed even though only eth0 is active) and what should
"ifconfig" show AFTER the grase installation.

I hope you can help me figure out if this is simply a hardware isse or if
I'm doing something wrong...

Thanks,
Benjamin
