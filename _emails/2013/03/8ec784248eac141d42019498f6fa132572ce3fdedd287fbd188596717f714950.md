For basic blocking, you'll need to do some research into using squid to 
filter pages. Then put the relevant config in a file in 
/etc/squid3/grase.d/yourconfig.conf (where yourconfig is a name you give 
the file)

However, you won't be able to block SSL easily, so maybe ask yourself 
the question of why you are trying to block your user from certain 
sites, instead of limiting their access. Often giving customers free 
wifi, that is not giving them access to all the websites they want, is 
exactly what they don't want. You are better to give them free "limited" 
wifi (i.e. 50Mb or 30 mins) that they can waste on what ever they want.

If it's not customers but kids for example, then look into something 
like OpenDNS for blocking sites, in combination with squid filtering.
