Thanks Tim. This pppoe connection is without using any modem. I have looked
at some of the tutorials available on the net. They all seem to be related
to adsl type pppoe connection. I don't know whether both of them are
similar in configuration. Can you please help me point to correct tutorial,
if at all possible for you?

The clients point to the Grase server, which points to a local DNS
server which points to the upstream servers you define in the Grase
Admin section. It's there you should set your WAN DNS servers. It's not
recommended trying to have your clients communicate directly with the
upstream servers as that offers a way to let people bypass the portal if
they really want to (look up DNS proxy stuff). It's also faster having a
local caching proxy. If things arent' working through grase, check that
you can resolve names to ip addresses, if so, it's not the DNS that's an

issue.


I am able to ping almost every website I wish to open through Grase however
not all websites are loading. They just seem to get stuck. Also, there is a
noticeable time difference in load time when I am using Grase and when I am
not using it. Are these the local DNS servers: 208.67.222.123
 208.67.220.123? I have put in details of the DNS servers provided to me by
my ISP in /etc/network/interfaces. Am I wrong in putting the details there?

Thanks.
