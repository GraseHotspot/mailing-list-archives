## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello All
 
I'm sure this is a really simple thing to do but I just can't figure out how to do it.  I've been running grase for some time now really sucessfully at the company I work for (an emergency service).  So sucessful that I've had a request to put it in on another site.  The two sites are linked together.  Let's say siteA is 10.1.0.X and siteB is 10.1.1.X.  The routers internally are 10.1.0.254 and 10.1.1.254.  Network traffic passes between them just fine, although computers on site B can't ping the grase server, although they can ping other PCs on siteA.
 
I suspect this is something to do with the internal routing table in ubuntu but I've added a route into the grase server for 10.1.1.0 with a gateway of 10.1.0.254 and it still doesn't seem to want to play.
 
Has anyone achieved this?
 
Most Gratefully
Steve{% endraw %}
