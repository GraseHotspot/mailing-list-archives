{% raw  %}Hi Daniel

Please subscribe to the list before posting again.

It sounds like you are doing Layer 3 routing on the dd-wrt. You need to do
Layer 2 routing only. This means no ip address and dhcp on dd-wrt for that
interface. Also known as a "bridge". I've not got my dd-wrt device handy at
the moment so can't give you any guidance as to the right settings.

You'll know it's setup right because the client will have an ip address in
the 10.1.0.x range.
