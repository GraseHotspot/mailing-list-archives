Hi Pablo

The grase.d folder should in theory work. You'll see at the bottom of 
the squid.conf.grase file, the following line
include /etc/squid3/grase.d/*.conf
This means it'll load any files in that directory that end in .conf 
after loading all of the squid.conf.grase file. (The squid.conf.grase 
file is setup to override the squid.conf file, so the squid.conf file is 
ignored).

Make sure your files in grase.d are named with .conf on the end.

Otherwise try "squid3 -f /etc/squid3/squid.conf.grase -X" and look 
through the debug output to see what's happening when it loads. You may 
need to run that with sudo or as root.
