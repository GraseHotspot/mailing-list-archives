Hi Paul.

Just log a feature request at trac.grasehotspot.org

At this stage, it's not likely to be implemented soon, although maybe 
with the voucher purchasing system it might be. Given that most users 
are currently manually created, having an email field has little value 
as they are already known to the operator. We are also bordering on the 
line of managing users, and a CRM (Customer Relationship Manager), and 
so we need to start asking the questions, how much information do we 
want to store, and what defines a user now, is it a contact first in the 
CRM and then the contact has a voucher which has a username and 
password? Or is the username and password the contact, etc etc. Can an 
email address be duplicated or does it have to be unique?

Tim
