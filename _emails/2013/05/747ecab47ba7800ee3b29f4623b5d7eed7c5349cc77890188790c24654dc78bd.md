## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi all,

I thought that I had seen the answer to this somewhere, but can't for the life of me find it now.

I have just had to replace our Grase computer due to hardware failure. I had an already set up and working replacement Grase computer, and my plan was to restore the database backup from the old computer but I could not find instructions on how to do this.

I have it working now, but for future reference can someone please point me to the instructions to restore the Grase backup?

Thanks in advance....
