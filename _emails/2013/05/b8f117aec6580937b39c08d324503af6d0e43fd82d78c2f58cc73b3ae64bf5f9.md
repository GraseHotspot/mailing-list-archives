## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi all/Tim,

How would I go about setting up forwarding an external port through Grase to a computer on the local network? The internal computer has a static IP that is in the same subnet that Grase uses, but is outside the DHCP addresses that Grase hands out, so there should be no conflict there.

I have previously (pre Grase) fiddled with iptables to achieve this, but I expect that Grase's use of iptables would break any changes I made (and possibly visa-versa).

Any help greatly appreciated.
