And by the looks of things, even this query is way too slow if your 
database is say a year old. I'm going to put an upgrade script in the 
next release that will probably just truncate the radpostauth table, or 
at least remove all but 1000 rows or something (most likely a truncate).
In a database backup (compressed) it went from 2Mb to 150K for a system 
that's been running for over a year. That's a lot of extra crud sitting 
in the database slowing things down and consuming disk space.
