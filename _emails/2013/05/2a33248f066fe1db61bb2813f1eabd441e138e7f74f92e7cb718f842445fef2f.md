Yeah. This one will be OK. There is a lot of media and video stuff on 
it. Try to disable in bios everything you don't really need. One SO DIMM 
2Gb modul will be more then enough.
However, if you itend to use this case from link, I must tell you that 
will be quite crowdy inside. Those power wires will make the most mess. 
Since this is passive cooled board more air would be desirable.
I had an issue recently with similar case slightly bigger and with fan 
on side wall. Well, fan stopped working after a year, what made 
temperature rise inside and guess what?  2.5" HD die.
If you need additional tips regarding heating/cooling issue, feel free 
to contact me.
