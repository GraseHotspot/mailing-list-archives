## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Automatic redirection from the OS is a feature of the OS. Try visiting
http://clients3.google.com/generate_204 on a computer and see if you get a
redirect then.

Check if you can ping both the hotspot (default 10.1.0.1)  and say google
DNS (8.8.8.8) to see if you are connected to the server, and potentially
already authenticated somehow to the internet.

Regards

Tim
