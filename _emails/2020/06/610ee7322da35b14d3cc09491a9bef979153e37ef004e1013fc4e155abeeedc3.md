## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Stephan

If you browse to a non-ssl website does it work? You should be able to use
http://clients3.google.com/generate_204 to test.

It's up to the device to do a request that will trigger the redirect. The
redirect will only work on non-ssl sites, and all modern operating systems
have a mechanism to detect this automatically nowadays (and prompt to login
to the network).

What error are you seeing?

Regards

Tim
