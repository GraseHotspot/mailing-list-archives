## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}To assist in directing my time and resources appropriately, I've prepared a
short (2 minute) survey that I'd appreciate if you could fill in. Please
fill it in both if you do and don't use the current remote access VPN.

To be clear, while the package is the grase-conf-openvpn and is often
referred to as a VPN, it doesn't provide any VPN functionality to clients,
or to the server, for protecting normal internet traffic. The VPN only
provides access to Grase Hotspot server's for the benefit of remotely
connecting to your server.

https://forms.gle/Uwejp9drR8pYY9cv7

Part of the reason for asking these questions is it's become apparent that
there may be issues with running a VPN in it's current form, and so I need
to work out if it's worth spending time making it more secure (and easier
to use), as well as how to cover those costs. Again, the VPN package was
something born out of a need many years ago to remotely access installs
without exposing them to the internet, and I didn't expect someday we'd
have more than 250 devices connected to that VPN. It has peaked at > 350
devices previously, but I've been forcing clients to update to the latest
version to stay connected to reduce the number of out dated clients
installed.

Regards

Tim
