## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim,

Nice to hear news (directly) from you since...

The issue is created with a slightly modified title "Group configuration: 
Assigning different volume and speed limitations to a Group depending on 
the time of day #192".

We are all excited to discover and run V4 very soon...

Thks one more time for keeping alive our mervelous software grasehotspot.
