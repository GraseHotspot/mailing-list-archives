## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hello ZOMBLEWOU� (and all others who are interested in this topic)

I wrote here in the past several times. I can't imagine scenario in 
which one wish to install Grase on different OS, or as dual boot 
machine.. or.....can't remember what else great questions popup here.

GRASE is router! It is very special part of network with very special 
tasks. It is out of sense run it on desktop, other server, or as dual 
boot. Even you need to try it for awhile, rather use spare disk, replace 
it on your notebook, and don't mess with dual boot for one time.
Best option use old notebook, old PC, and try Grase there. Such 
installation may serve you later for real.

Don't forget you need second network card. It is easy to add one at the 
old PC assuming one is already there and working. For Notebook you will 
need usb-to-ethernet adapter to get second network card. Some of which 
used to be tricky , but majority I used worked with Ubuntu from box.

Here is mine example , bit outdated, but still working.:

And another advice, Ubuntu!
Grase is build on Ubuntu primary. So don't ask for debian, or any other 
linux. They are all same, One just having trouble installing Grase on 
other distro with bothering Tom here for help.
Again Grase is router. Advanced one. Same as your home telecom router, 
Same as DD-WRT, Open-WRT, pfsense, Microtik, Cisco and many others.
It is headless black box in your network. You are accessing by web or by 
shell remotely. Don't mess with unusual installation which has no 
sense.� Prepare hardware, put Ubuntu , pull Grase and you are good.

Hope this helps
