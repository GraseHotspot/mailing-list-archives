## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Yayato

This isn't currently something that's been implemented. While it is
possible with Freeradius/Coova Chilli, it requires some complicated custom
programming in Freeradius to be implemented. It also relies on something
called COA (Change Of Authorization) which adds complexity to the setup.

As much as I'd love to be able to support this, it's not currently planned
due to the significant complexity increase in the Freeradius/Coova Chilli
integration, and the extra code that needs to be written for FreeRadius to
handle this. Feel free to create an issue for it (
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues) so we can attempt
it in the future.

Regards

Tim
