## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

May I kindly ask if the Installation at 
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/wiki/Installation up to 
date for the latest stable please?

Would like to update a few of our grase setups so we can resolve some speed 
issues and at least get upgraded to the latest.

Would like to at least know which Ubuntu LTS to use mainly, should be able 
to figure out the rest but would be good to post it out for the others as 
well.

Many thanks for this brilliant piece of work!

Cheers from Kiribati!!

Karotu
