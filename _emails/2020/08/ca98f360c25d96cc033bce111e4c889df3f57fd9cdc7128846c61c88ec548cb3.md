Hey All
 
I know it's been a while, but we are continuing to plod along.
 
At this stage, I expect V4 nightly builds to be useable for basic use. I have completed a first-run wizard that you need to run for the initial setup.
 
It is important to note that we no longer ship with a default username/password. You will need to run the first-run wizard to set the initial admin password. This can also be rerun later on to force a password reset.
 
I have written up the instructions at https://grasehotspot.org/documentation/v4-nightly-builds/ for getting started and how to run the first-run wizard. If you already have V4 packages installed, you and just "apt upgrade" and then run the first-run wizard.
 
It would be really appreciated if people can start testing it, as it's hard for me to make sure there are no show stopper bugs when I don't have any places this is running in public.
 
Regards
 
Tim

Hello Tim,

I would appreciate some clarification on "basic use".  Reason I ask is that I am planning to upgrade the backpackers server in the next couple of weeks, and I would be more than willing to upgrade grase at the same time providing that the following is actually working at this time:

1) I need mac address authentication to be working as the property owner has a solar battery bank that is also connected into the mains that has a wifi card in it for monitoring purposes.

2) Have you upgraded the radius package yet?


So yeah, it is really the mac address that is absolutely essential to me, along with being able to add the usernames/passwords.  There are many different devices used here, laptops and various phones along with googles chrome cast device, so this would be a really good testing bed if it is up to this level already.  I do not care if things such as log files and nice to have extras are not available.  

My thoughts are that I will keep the existing hard drive so that I can switch back to it if the new hotspot proves too problematic.  I am getting an M.2 drive for the new server so that in the event of a power failure the system will be back online again in a very short amount of time.  The current hardware is a number of years old now, so the upgrade is past due.

Regards,

Christopher.
