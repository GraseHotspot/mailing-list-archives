## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Reflex

Glad the installation went smoothly. Batch users is something I was
delaying until all the other user/group stuff was completed. Creating
groups seems to have just been missed! Thanks for pointing that out. I'll
have that fixed next time I get a block of time to work on it.

It would be useful to me to know exactly how you want batch users to
function. It's been hacked together in so many different ways previously
for different use cases (including printing vouchers, CSV export, etc). Do
you like the random usernames it generates? Would something less random be
better? Do you need printing of vouchers, or is a CSV good enough?
(Printing I hope to one day support direct receipt printers and things like
that, but there are so many use cases it's hard to accommodate them all).

Thanks for testing it out!

Regards

Tim
