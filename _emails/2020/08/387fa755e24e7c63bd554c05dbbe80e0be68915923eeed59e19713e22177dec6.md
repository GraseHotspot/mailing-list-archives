## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim,

I am now really confused by what is happening in this version of the hotspot.  It seems that accounts are automatically being created, which is not what I want at all.  I have accounts setup and yet I am seeing a bunch of autocreated accounts.  Is there a way to prevent this happening?  This is going to play havoc with people who live in countries where they have to keep track of usage.

I did try deleting one of the autocreated accounts earlier, and it gave a 500 internal server error when I went back to check the active sessions.  I added that account back and the error went away.

Overall I love the look of this new version, and people are able to surf the internet.  I do realise this is a pre-release.

Regards,

Christopher.
