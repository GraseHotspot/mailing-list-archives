## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Christopher

Sorry for the delay.

I've not written the interface for adding Mac devices yet. However, they
are actually normal accounts with a few special features. First, the
username is the Mac address (all caps, separated by -, e.g.
AA-10-BB-A8-CC-D2). The password is stored in the radreply table, there
should be a row similar to:
CoovaChilli, ChilliSpot-Config, +=, macpasswd=password
This will give you the mac password that you can use for your mac accounts.
I know that's not a convenient way to manage mac accounts, but it's
passable once you have that password. (And if you're taking the existing
database from V3 and upgrading it, then all the existing mac accounts will
be there, and you can just view them to get the password).

There have been major upgrades to Freeradius, hopefully that's what you're
looking for.

The many things missing in V4 atm are a nice interface for computer
accounts, bulk users, admin user management, reports. The basics of
adding/creating/modifying users/groups all work, and for /most/ settings
you can use the advanced settings page to change anything (other than
CoovaChilli database settings).

I hope that gives you some idea of the current state of things.

Regards

Tim
