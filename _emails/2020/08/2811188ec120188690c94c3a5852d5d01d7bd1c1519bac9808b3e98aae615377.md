## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim,

I upgraded the server hardware yesterday, and this caused the working version 3 of the hotspot to refuse internet access except for 1 international site.  At that point I bit the bullet and installed Devuan Beowulf 3.0.0, which is basically debian without the systemd garbage.

I have been successfully able to add all the users to the new system, and I am currently logged in via the hotspot to send this email.

I have found an error when attempting to look at the network settings in the admin page:

/sys/class/net/eth0 /sys/class/net/eth1
Oops! An Error Occurred
The server returned a "500 Internal Server Error".
Something is broken. Please let us know what you were doing when this error occurred. We will fix it as soon as possible. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.

I also noticed that in the instructions for installing this version of the hotspot, that there is no mention of squid.  Is this still on the todo list, or has squid been dropped?

When I ran the "first time wizard, after I had installed everything, I received an negative value error for the wan network card, so I rebooted the server and re-ran the wizard.  Could this be what has caused the internal server error?

Regards,

Christopher.
