## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim,

After many battles, I seem to have managed to get this to work correctly.  I have no idea at this stage what *exactly* made it work, but it is indeed now showing in radius.log that people are being rejected.

The thing that was constant with it not working, was the warning that the "sql" module was being ignored when freeradius started up.  Now I only get the warning that the "ldap" module is ignored, which I am not using anyway.

If it would assist you in getting it working for this version of freeradius, I am more than willing to upload the conf files to pastebin so that you can perhaps test it on your dev box when you have time.  I can even provide a dump of the current mysql database if you need it, though as I have stated below, I have added every user-account to the radcheck table, by adding a new column to accommodate it.

I just wish I knew what the final "solution" was.

I even upgraded from freeradius 3.0.17 to 3.0.21 as this is available in the buster-backports.

Regards,

Christopher.

I notice that you have defined DEFAULT_GRASE in your files.  I am not sure if that overrides the DEFAULT group or not, so I even tried adding DEFAULT_GRASE but that did not work.

> I am somewhat confused by the documentation stating to include the "sql" module in the session, accounting and post-auth sections, as you seem to be mostly using your own grasesql and adding -sql to conditionally load the module results in some rather spectacular failures.  Granted this is probably due to me not being a programmer.
