## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

I like the new interface. Installation went smoothly. Liked that there were
more config choices during the installation and noticed that in the
advanced options there were more options to change stuff in one place.

I am however not seeing some of the options that were available in the
previous version such as the Batch Users, Ability to add groups. Guessing
they will be added soon. Good job so far.

Regards
{% endraw %}
