## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hey All

I know it's been a while, but we are continuing to plod along.

At this stage, I expect V4 nightly builds to be useable for basic use. I
have completed a first-run wizard that you need to run for the initial
setup.

It is important to note that we no longer ship with a default
username/password. You will need to run the first-run wizard to set the
initial admin password. This can also be rerun later on to force a password
reset.

I have written up the instructions at
https://grasehotspot.org/documentation/v4-nightly-builds/ for getting
started and how to run the first-run wizard. If you already have V4
packages installed, you and just "apt upgrade" and then run the first-run
wizard.

It would be really appreciated if people can start testing it, as it's hard
for me to make sure there are no show stopper bugs when I don't have any
places this is running in public.

Regards

Tim
