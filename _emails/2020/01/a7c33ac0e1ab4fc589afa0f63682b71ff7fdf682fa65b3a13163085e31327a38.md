## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Take a look at archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ <http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu>

I'mma getting that squishy feeling from a permissions problem.  I put an
ubuntu.html page at /var/www/html/ubuntu, and I still get "Permission
denied" when I browse to http://192.168.0.200/ubuntu.
