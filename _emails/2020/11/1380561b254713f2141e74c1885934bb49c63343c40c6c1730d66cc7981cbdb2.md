Subject: [GRASE-Hotspot] V4 Alpha Builds Error on Network Settings
Hi everyone! It's so good to see this project moving on. V3 is amazing and this new build looks promising.
 
So, was able to install the V4 Alpha Build on top of my LAMP Server (Ubuntu 18.04) and managed to have the login and IP allocations and everything seems working great. I only have one question regarding my current "500 Internal Server Error" on "grase/settings/network". 
 

Anybody encountered the same error? Please I need your help how did you managed to have the network settings back to work. Here are the logs for reference:

Hello Gerard,

I posted a few weeks back now on this exact issue.  To date Tim has either not had time, or has overlooked it, but no response has been made.

I can assure you that V4 works without any issues.  I live at a backpackers and the hotspot has had heavy use since I installed it for the property owner.

Regards,

Christopher.
