hi TIM I wanted a Mac address to be connected by a single ip address. There 
are a few people in my industry who try to bypass server security by 
cloning mac address. reason why I want to limit the number to 1add ip for 
1add mac. I know it's on the chilli service menu but I don't know where 
exactly.
