## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Daniel,

That is the complaint. No porn through the hotspot. I have been using
version 3.8 for a while now and did not realise this was a problem. The
system has been restarted several times and there that is not the solution.
Is there any config file I can check?

Regards
