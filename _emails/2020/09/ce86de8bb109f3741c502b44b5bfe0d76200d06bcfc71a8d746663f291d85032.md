## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim,

I am sorry to keep on with this, but I really do need this to work.

I have located the line that you mentioned in radreply and changed macpasswd=password to my preferred password.  This does not allow the two accounts to connect to the hotspot.  I uncompressed the latest backup made of the old V3 and verified that it is indeed the correct place for the password to reside.

The one thing that I am confused about, is that you say that the mac addresses need to be entered in all caps, and yet even in the V3 mysql database they are stored all in lowercase.  I have tried adding the password to the mysql database, matching it like it is in the V3 database, but it never authenticates.  It only shows up in the dhcpleases in a "dnat" state.

I really do not want to wipe the database and re-import the V3 and have it upgraded, as I do not see how this is going to change anything.  I have even gone so far as to create the macaddress account with lower case letters, and that did not work.

Is there some other place within the database or config files that I need to change something?

Regards,

Christopher.
