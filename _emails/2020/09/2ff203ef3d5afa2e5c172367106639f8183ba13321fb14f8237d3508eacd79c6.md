## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Chris

Assuming the radreply lines are correct, you may need to force reload Coova
Chilli. I currently have limited ability to test things like MAC auth as my
testing machine is currently having a hard drive rebuilt (from backups).

You can try setting the default config to match the database, edit
/etc/chilli/config and find the commented out HS_MACPASSWD line, uncomment
it and update it to the MAC auth password you've set in the database.

HS_MACAUTH=on              # To turn on MAC Authentication
#HS_MACPASSWD="password"

Again, force reload coova-chilli.

I'd also look in the radpostauth table to see if you can even see
authentication attempts, that (and the freeradius logs) should at least
show if a MAC auth is being attempted, and what the username format is.
There really is no difference between a MAC account and a normal account,
except that the macpasswd is fixed, and it's automatically logged in by
CoovaChilli at DHCP time.

Once my HDD rebuild is complete, I'll spin up my VMs and do some MAC
testing (and fixup the interface too)

Regards

Tim
