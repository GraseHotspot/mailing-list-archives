## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim,

I have been fighting to get Simultaneous-Use working for a few days now, and what I have done does not seem to be working, even though the freeradius 3.0 docs and forums/mailing lists that I have scoured state that it does.

I am going to outline what I have done, then move onto what I have discovered in your graseperl script.

I first added the Simultaneous-Use := 1 line into the radgrooup check in the freeradius database, like you had in the previous version.  That in itself did not work, so it was at that point I went hunting for how to make it work.

I also have added a new "column" to radcheck in the database and added every user there to have the Simultaneous-Use := 1 in there.

Then on one of the freeradius groups, someone said that they added the following to /etc/freeradius/3.0/users file:

DEFAULT Simultaneous-Use := 1
        Fall-Through = Yes

Even this does not appear to work.  From the notes in the file DEFAULT is a special group that applies to all users, so it should have worked.  I notice that you have defined DEFAULT_GRASE in your files.  I am not sure if that overrides the DEFAULT group or not, so I even tried adding DEFAULT_GRASE but that did not work.

After taking a look at your graseperl script, I notice that there is a function for checksimul, but that along with all but two functions are commented out.  From looking at the sql_counters.pl file in the perl-modules the database connection is commented out.

I have no idea at this stage if simultaneous use still has to have more coding done by you to work.

I have enabled radutmp in the configuration, as I am not sure if a database lookup is being performed or not.  Before activating this, radwho showed no connections,  now it shows the logged in users.

I am somewhat confused by the documentation stating to include the "sql" module in the session, accounting and post-auth sections, as you seem to be mostly using your own grasesql and adding -sql to conditionally load the module results in some rather spectacular failures.  Granted this is probably due to me not being a programmer.

Regards,

Christopher.
