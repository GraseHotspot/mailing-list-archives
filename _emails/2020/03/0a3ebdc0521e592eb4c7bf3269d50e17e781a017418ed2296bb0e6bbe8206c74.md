## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi

Currently, I can't support manually setting up and installing the VPN. The
package does automated key generation, CSR submission, and CRT installing
as well as configuring OpenVPN. We also use low certificate expiry's so if
you run it on a linux computer and then copy the key and config, you may
find you have to do that every 6-12 months.

Regards

Tim
