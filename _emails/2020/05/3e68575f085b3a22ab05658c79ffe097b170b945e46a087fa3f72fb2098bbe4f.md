*Hi boss Tim* I need your help. It has been two weeks since I have a big 
problem with my grase server. All my users who have a computer cannot 
connect to the server, but those who use phones and tablets have access and 
work properly. I thereafter noticed that all that is computer does not 
receive an IP address and even the basic login page does not even appear. I 
also notice that sometimes the computer manages to connect and after a 
short time the problem still occurs. I don't know what to do I try 
everything but no solution. Sorry help me.
{% endraw %}
