## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Shirish

There are currently development packages being built which are loaded into
the dev apt repo (https://apt.grasehotspot.org/dev/), currently, only the
bionic builds are in there.

A better option to see the new interface and progress is the devdemo at
https://devdemo.grasehotspot.org

The development packages do install, however there is currently an issue
with the initial database deployment, as I'm trying to work out how to best
support upgrading from V3 as well as doing clean deployments easily. My
intended method for upgrading from V3, while it kinda works, is reliant on
certain components working correctly between the upgrades. I'm instead
going to change to doing clean installs for V4, and then provide a
migration tool to take the V3 database backups and load them into a new V4
instance. This makes the most sense anyway as there is a large jump in
supported distributions, and doing a dist-upgrade from each one is likely
to break something in a way I can't test. This way, we get a clean database
that we can import previous backups into.

Once I have a way to install (both fresh and with V3 migrations) I'll post
detailed instructions here.

Regards

Tim
