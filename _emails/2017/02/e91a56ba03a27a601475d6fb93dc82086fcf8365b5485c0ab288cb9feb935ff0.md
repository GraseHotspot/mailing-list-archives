## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}This is not the issue, it is on all users, authenticated (devices I have setup using the “computer” user group) and non-authenticated (I am using the “free” button at the moment whilst Beta testing) alike. It also only seems to be Facebook that is at fault. Since I am still in Beta phase (system is not fully rolled out) I am thinking of a complete reload (once again, 5th time :/  ) and just being a bit more careful with my updates. Unless someone can offer a better solution

 

(it is Friday 24/02/2017 10:00:00 here, I shall do the B.F.R (backup format reload) in 24 hours unless I get a different solution)

If looking on your issue, it's possible that the user haven't been authenticated yet. On mobile with latest OS such ase android 5+, usually the moment you enter grase network, login page will popup. Although, if it doesn't appear directly, either in smartphone or PC, just open web browser and go for non secure site first. With that, grase uam is triggered and will ask user to enter login information.

Hope this help you. :)

Regard,
Jerren

I have recently started having issues with my users not being able to log into facebook through the hotspot.

it seems to be an issue with the htpps system. i know that grase does not filter these by default (and i am running a basically default 3.8.0 system here on ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS) i have run apt-get update/upgrade/dist-upgrade/autoremove (in that order) and rebooted the system a few times. nothing seems to fix the problem. (so far it only seems to be facebook that is having an issue).

any help would be appreciated 

(i have not worked in a linux server environment for almost 12 years so i am treating it almost like a windows server)
