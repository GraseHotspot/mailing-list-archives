## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}There are fundamentally two ways.

1. You can write an iptables rule that simply blocks traffic from 10.1.0.0/24. To destination 192.168.1.0/24. This works primarily because the the clients should not ever need to connect to an endpoint in the 192.168.1.x network. 
Yes the packets will go through there, but the packet is not destined for it unless they have tried to connect to an ip in that space.

2. Create a third v-LAN and have the wan of grase in that third v-LAN. This effectively creates a DMZ just for grase. Just remember though that creating that v-LAN alone is not enough, you then use the firewall on your router to restrict access from the new third v-LAN (Grase DMZ) to the original wan (office) network. The main benefit of this method is that it keeps all your customised firewall / access rules in your main firewall/router rather than some in the firewall and some in grase. You probably also have a nicer interface for managing the rules on your main router.
