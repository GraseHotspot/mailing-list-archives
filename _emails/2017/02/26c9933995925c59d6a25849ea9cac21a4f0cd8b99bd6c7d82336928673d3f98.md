1 - You need to examine MySQL database "radius" so that you understand what 
rows you have to create, take special attention to the Expire setting, 
since it seems you will need it. Understanding how to create a voucher in 
MySQL help making what you need.

2 - You need to create an endpoint (php url) inside de grase code directory 
where you can submit custom data from your hotel software (in any format, i 
sugest using JSON) and have your custom PHP code create the voucher, the 
rest will be taken care by grase as it is. You just need to create the 
voucher in database, according to freeradius needs. 

3 - As for the Room And persons name, I would use the voucher comment field 
to add that values.
