## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Not ideal but useful suggestion:
Move user temporary to new group. (Name it "SingleUserPrintGroup" or 
whatever you like) then simple use that "Print group" option.
Move user back to original group.
Keep in mind that if exist "user time/or data limit within original 
group, both will reset to initial start value when you move user back to 
original group.
