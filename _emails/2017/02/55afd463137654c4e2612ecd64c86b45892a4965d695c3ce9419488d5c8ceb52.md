## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}If looking on your issue, it's possible that the user haven't been 
authenticated yet. On mobile with latest OS such ase android 5+, usually 
the moment you enter grase network, login page will popup. Although, if it 
doesn't appear directly, either in smartphone or PC, just open web browser 
and go for non secure site first. With that, grase uam is triggered and 
will ask user to enter login information.

Hope this help you. :)

Regard,
Jerren
