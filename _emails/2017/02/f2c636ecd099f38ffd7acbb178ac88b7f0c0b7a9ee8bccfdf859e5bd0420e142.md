## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I have recently started having issues with my users not being able to log 
into facebook through the hotspot.

it seems to be an issue with the htpps system. i know that grase does not 
filter these by default (and i am running a basically default 3.8.0 system 
here on ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS) i have run apt-get 
update/upgrade/dist-upgrade/autoremove (in that order) and rebooted the 
system a few times. nothing seems to fix the problem. (so far it only seems 
to be facebook that is having an issue).

any help would be appreciated 

(i have not worked in a linux server environment for almost 12 years so i 
am treating it almost like a windows server)
{% endraw %}
