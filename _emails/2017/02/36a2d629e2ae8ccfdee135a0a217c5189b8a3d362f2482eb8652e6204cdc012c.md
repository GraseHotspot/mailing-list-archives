## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}While I appreciate that this method works, it only allows the users to access the windows shares. What I want to do is centralise the contact for the users within the Grase network, in other words I would like them to access a samba share on the Ubuntu box that has the windows box (on the outside) mounted and sharing what I have on both boxes in one place.  My second mail (to this thread) was what I was hoping to get as the end point to this. A “streaming” media server that can be shared with the users who do not have a user account. 

 

Basically I have run out of space on the windows server and will be installing more drives and more data into the Ubuntu box. Grase is just the Internet guardian (as Data in my country is expensive, us$80.00 for a simple uncapped 10M ADSL connection). I would also rather the users of my network not stream from the internet as this also is detrimental to the others (it kills the bandwidth) saying all this I would also like them to be able to access it from their mobile devices (hence the streaming and why I have given up on the samba share)  as stated earlier, I am a n008 and have forgotten how powerful Linux can be and is now learning everything once again from scratch.

Looking at your first email, are you trying to share windows files from a windows computer, with other windows computers that are behind Grase? If so, you just need the IP address to connect. (\\192.168.0.34\ <file:///\\192.168.0.34\>  in Windows Explorer for example). I don't know why you want the Grase server to reshare files from the windows server.

 

Regards


Tim

Hi,

I am new (well really old... haven't used any Linux flavors in almost 10 years and have forgotten most of it, having to re-teach myself everything all over again, any way i digress) 

I have two separate servers, the one is loaded with windows 2008 r2 and is basically a glorified N.A.S. server, this is on the WAN side of my network, i then have a second server setup with Ubuntu14.04 that i have installed GRASE Hotspot onto and have setup a wireless network through this. what i would like to do is be able to share the files that i mount on the Linux server from the windows server to the internal network. (i know this is possible as i had this working on a separate install without GRASE). my problem seems that as soon as i setup the smb.conf file with an open guest (read only) share (specifying the network cards), the GRASE stops working, if i take out the specified network card, the server does not show in network discovery.

some step by step assistance (or point me to the right link) would be highly appreciated

Daniel (closeted N008)

(i can try post more info and files if you want.... i am on a windows machine on the WAN side and have no clue how to transfer the files, i just transcribe from one machine to the other... its a mission)
