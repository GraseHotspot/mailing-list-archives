## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I am unsure if this has been covered (or if this is the right place to ask 
this) I would like to know if it is possible to reprint just a single users 
ticket.

some info:
I have setup GRASE with a few groups (monthly,weekly weekends) and i add 
users to these groups (just using the bandwidth limit and time limit 
features for now) i have also setup the ticket system to print some extra 
information (rules and support info) i have also increased the default size 
of the tickets (from 5.5 cm to 14cm, as i print each ticket on an A4 laser 
printer) I then hand the client the ticket. Now I know that my clients are 
going to lose their tickets and come to me for a reprint. I have looked all 
over and i cannot find a way to print just that one users ticket after i 
have setup their account. I have found the "print group" link, but this 
brings up the entire group. Going into the user also does not illicit any 
options for reprinting the ticket.

i am on GRASE   v3.8.0 (please let me know if there is anything else i can 
supply you to assist in solving this problem)
{% endraw %}
