## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Glyn

You probably haven't noticed it before, because it's for the total of a
"session", which is from when the hotspot last booted. If your hotspot runs
for a few days, it ends up down the bottom of a long list, and easily
missed.
I have excluded it from the reports, but not from the sessions list. If
it's to confusing, maybe we should exclude it from there as well? I like
having it so I can see the total data since the last reboot.

Regards

Tim
