I have around 40-50 clients.

I have set the range :
DHCP Start 30
DHCP End 223


I have made the change you said...rebooting and i will let you know if a few mins.

Also, if you actually want more IP's (i.e. you actually have more than 190 odd clients on the network, you need to edit Coova Chilli Settings and set DHCP end to something larger. Given your network mask I'd go maybe 1000.

Hi Thomas


Can you please collect support information (https://grasehotspot.org/support/collecting-support-information/) so we can see some of the settings. I suspect there is a network misconfiguration, as it shouldn't be handing out IP's on our LAN interface as well.


Also, have you tried a reboot? Sometimes after you change some network settings, the restart doesn't work properly and you end up with 2 chilli instances running on different interfaces.


Regards


Tim

Hello!
Have a great year to everyone!!


I'm reposting again since I had no reply from the past.

My Grase installation has this problem : I have 2 network cards with, the one with ip 10.1.0.1 and the second with my lan ip.
DHCP server keeps sending requests on my lan and for that reason, i get all the 10.1.0.1 range full after a while and no other can connect.


15:11:37 coova-chilli[7406]: chilli.c: 5117: New DHCP request from MAC=B8-38-61-83-E4-C1
Jan  2 15:11:37 coova-chilli[7406]: chilli.c: 5005: Client MAC=B8-38-61-83-E4-C1 assigned IP 10.1.0.174

I have to restart chilli server.

Any ideas on what to check?

Thank you
