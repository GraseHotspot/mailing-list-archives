## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}What kind of record do you need? If it's just usernames and when they are
created, then that's stored in the Admin log currently.

If you actually need complete session logs, we currently sum up session
logs after a month and write a monthly summary into another table, removing
the session logs. Otherwise the session database table is too big to use
efficiently.
My best solution for complete session logs is the nightly backups. If you
ever need to look at a session log, find the nightly backup for the end of
that month, restore to another machine and extract the logs that way.
(You'd need to manually backup the squid logs).

Otherwise, yes, you could disable the deletion of users (
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/blob/master/files/usr/share/grase/www/radmin/cron.php#L51),
just be prepared for a much bigger database. (You'll need to disable that
function after every upgrade)

Regards

Tim
