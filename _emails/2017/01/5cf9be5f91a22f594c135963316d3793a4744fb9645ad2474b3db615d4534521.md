## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim et all,
I've been away from the mailing list recently so I'm asking for suggestion 
before installing a new machine with the latest GRASE release.

This will be a ubuntu 16.04 (server) targeting an average of 200 users with 
peaks of 300. in front of the grase machine there is a fw/router with FTTH.
based on my experience with the previous machine (ubuntu + grase 3.7) I 
have few questions:

1) is there some parameter for freeradius that I should tweak from the 
default install? I reading about the num_threads but I did not test it 
before, yet it seems likely something that I should increase...

2) mysql num of connections : seems another param to be increased with 200 
users to track ..

3) for 3.8 I don;t want to keep more than 2 weeks of history in my session 
database, is there a way I can automatically prune the database? I've seen 
few few emails with some scripts from Tim, are those ready to be used in 
production?

4) firewall: is there a way to disable the internal firewall on GRASE? I 
just need access control, all port filtering is done from the fw/router in 
front of the grase machine itself.

thanks a lot in advance
{% endraw %}
