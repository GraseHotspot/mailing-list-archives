## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I was hoping to release updated package's for Ubuntu 16.04 later this week.
However, after working through getting all the dependencies correctly
packaged, and building new repositories for Ubuntu 16.04, I've hit a major
roadblock.
Due to the upgrade to PHP7, the database library that was being used is not
compatible with PHP7 (even though it seems to claim it is, it's an old
library).

For now, I've put enough time into trying to get this to work, that I'm
going to turn my efforts back to the rewrite of the database code instead,
as this will allow us to move forward in a much better way, instead of
relying on the old database code.

This means there will be no 3.8.0 release on Ubuntu 16.04, instead we'll be
waiting for the next major release.

I'm sorry about this setback, I was really hopefully I could do the minor
changes (Apache 2.4, Squid 3.5, etc), and buy us more time.

Regards

Tim
