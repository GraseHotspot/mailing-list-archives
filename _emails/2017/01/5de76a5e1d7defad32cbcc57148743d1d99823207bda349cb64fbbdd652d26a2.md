## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim,
thanks a lot for your reply, I always appreciate your accurate answers on 
the forum.

this hw is a machine from 3y ago that has been running 24/7 with a grase 3.7

I had few issues .. sometimes freeradius seems to get stuck, sometimes I 
think coova-chilli is the culprit (users cannot connect anymore) but since 
I could not debug easily I admin I always went for the brute force approach 
added a reboot every 2days or so.
now I have the time to upgrade the installation and I would like to get 
something more stable.

this is a DELL T320 with a Xeon(R) CPU E5-2407 0 @ 2.20GHz (4 cores) and 
16G of ram (plus a sata disk which is 60% free) and two Broadcom gigabit 
eth.
I think this should be plenty of hw for ~200 users on a 50Mbit/s peak of 
traffic, average of 30Mbit/s

one of the things that I investigated a while ago is the number of threads 
in squid.
the current system is running squid 3.1 and cannot go multithread, but I've 
seen that in 3.3 I can confugure for many threads.
I think that would be an interesting set to tweak by default.

regarding mysql, I've seen around that people suggest to double the default 
number of sockets when a lot of frequent connections to the db are 
needed... bah..

for freeradius I;ve seen this link, which seems interesting to test 
http://freeradius.org/features/scalability.html

thanks for the info on 16.04 ... I was not aware this is not yet a 
production release for GRASE.
I'll be waiting for that so I can upgrade with an LTS.

thanks
