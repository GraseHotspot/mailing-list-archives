{% raw  %}Hi Sergen

It sounds like the issue is "SMB over NAT". SMB is the windows file
sharing protocol, and it's not designed to work over NAT. Have a look
at https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/afacec9f-fb10-46cc-884e-1cd7877ef1da/accessing-file-shares-over-nat?forum=winserverfiles

I don't think it's actually iptables blocking them (unless you've
customised the default rules), but rather an issue with NAT or
Connection tracking (part of NAT). Why your iptables rules work, I'm
not entirely sure, but I'm fairly sure they break authentication
(allow everything through without authentication), and so you may as
well not have the Hotspot at all.

The hotspot isn't really designed for things like file sharing through
the hotspot, but controlling connections to the internet. Is there a
particular reason you are trying to do this from a client over the
hotspot? Could you instead install SMB on the Hotspot server, so the
clients can access a local SMB server (you'll need to allow the ports
for SMB to the hotspot server)??

Regards

Tim
