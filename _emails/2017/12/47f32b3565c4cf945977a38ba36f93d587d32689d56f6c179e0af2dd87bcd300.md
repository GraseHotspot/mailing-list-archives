{% raw  %}Hi Derek

The security of GRASE Hotspots is no different to to either a normal
network switch, or wireless access point. GRASE is just the gateway,
and doesn't control any of the "local" security. You'll find on your
wireless access points, there is often a setting to allow or disallow
clients to talk to each other. If you wish to prevent clients from
talking to each other (in a network sense), then you'll need to
disallow that. The same goes for network switches.

However, even if you don't disallow that between client communication,
assuming clients have a firewall, then this will protect them like in
any normal network.

Regards

Tim
