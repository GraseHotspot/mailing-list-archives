The LAN client gets an IP address OK and I can ping the GRASE LAN interface from the client. I note that, although the LAN interface is eth1 in the network settings page, it is shown as tun0 on the status page. Any advice gratefully received. (I did not install the grase-conf-openvpn package as I didn't think I'd need it.
