## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Thomas

Unfortunately 16.04 isn't supported yet. In January I attempted to
build packages for 16.04, and discovered that due to our use of Legacy
MySQL libraries, there is no easy way to package for 16.04. It will
probably have to be version 4 that goes on 16.04, and that's a long
way away currently.
The good news is, that because I support LTS releases, 14.04 is
supported by Ubuntu until 2019!! By then, if version 4 isn't released,
then this project would be dead.

Regards

Tim
