{% raw  %}Hi Luis

It's hard to know where your issues are coming from. Is it only on
Android devices? What version of Android are they running? What is the
error like? It sounds like you can't even connect to the WiFi, so it
may be a configuration issues with your WiFi hardware, not Grase.

Regards

Tim
