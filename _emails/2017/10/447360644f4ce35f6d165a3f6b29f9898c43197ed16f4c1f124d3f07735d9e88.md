## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Android version 6 and above have no problem. They are detecting the captive
portal and automatically forwarding to the login screen. However, the old
ones are not detecting automatically. If user opens a web browser after
wifi connection, most users' starting address is usually https://google.com.
Because of "https" the blank screen comes. Another point of Android users
is not typing the whole web address. They usually search the site name and
again Google's address is starting with "https" and it blocks to the login
page.
