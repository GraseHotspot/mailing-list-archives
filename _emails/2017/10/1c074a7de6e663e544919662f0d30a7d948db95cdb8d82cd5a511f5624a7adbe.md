## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hi Dave

I'll have to confirm, but the DNS settings on the Admin status page
are the DNS settings for the server. The DNS settings set in the
settings, are the upstream DNS settings for the clients. The clients
are all pointed to the Grase server, which itself has dnsmasq running,
which will point to whatever you've set in the Admin interface.
For the Admin interface to show that the local server is pointing to
127.0.01 is actually fine, as that means it'll use the local dnsmasq,
which in turn will use your DNS servers you have set in the settings.

Slightly confusing I know. The status page is a really old remnant,
and lots of it doesn't make as much sense as when it was written.

Regards

Tim
