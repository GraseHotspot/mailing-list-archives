## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim,

Thanks for your help. This is what I have done:

1. I loggin into my grase via radmin admin account and get rid of all the
reccursive dns ips and put the grase ip for my dns server. my client dns ip
now becomes the grase dns ip and when i request pages from the internet, it
works. So now I have verify that.

2. Second, I uncommended the /etc/chilli/ipup.sh iptable rule as you
mentioned and let grase resolve dns queries. i don't know why they are
commended out - those 2 iptables rules regarding dns queries.

So every thing works - just after you explained things to me.

So don't worry, if I have more difficulties, I will consult you and I know
your time is very important for the all grase community.

I will leave it here and thank for the tips and explanations.

Have a great evening

Tubeta
