## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Struan

You'd need to write backend code yourself to do this. There are plans in
the future to make this easier to customise, but not work has been done
yet, and it won't be worked on until the 4.1 release.

You can track it at
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/10

Regards

Tim
