## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Debian stretch is scheduled to become stable on June 17th. After that, 
Debian stable will have freeradius version 3.0.12 instead of 2.2.5.

Can Grase be expected to work with freeradius 3 / with Debian stable after 
June 17th?
Put the other way round: can we safely update the underlying Debian system 
to stable after June 17th?

Regards

Alan
