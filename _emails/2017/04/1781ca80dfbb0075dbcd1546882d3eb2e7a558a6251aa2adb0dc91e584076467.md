## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}For those who really do want to live on the bleeding edge, and help test
the new repositories before they become the main repositories, I've now
published the new nightly repo!

The apt sources list should be either
deb http://apt.grasehotspot.org/nightly jessie main
or
deb http://apt.grasehotspot.org/nightly trusty main
Depending on your distribution (jessie for Debian stable, trusty for Ubuntu
14.04).

This is a change from the previous system that used a single repository for
all Debian and Ubuntu distributions, which caused lots of packaging pain
when 1 distribution upgraded a major package, while the others didn't
(think squid, and apache).

I make no promises that the packages in this repository work. They should,
but no promises.
If you are interested to see which branches packages are coming from, have
a look at https://github.com/GraseHotspot/apt/blob/master/download.js#L10
That file shows which artifacts are being downloaded from the Gitlab build
system.

Please make sure if you find bugs in the nightly, that you make it clear
when reporting that you are using the nightly repository.

Regards

Tim
