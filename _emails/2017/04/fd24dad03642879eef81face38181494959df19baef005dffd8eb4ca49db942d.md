## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Thomas

You've tried most of the things I would have suggested. Can you please
collect support information as stated on the website (
https://grasehotspot.org/support/collecting-support-information/).

Can you do some tests using iperf and a server on the internet. Do a test
from the Hotspot server uploading, and then do a test from a client behind
the hotspot uploading. Lets see if it's a coova-chilli issue, or a Linux VM
issue.

Regards

Tim
