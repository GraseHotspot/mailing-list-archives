## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi 

This is of interest to me also, I have the same issue from time to time.

What i did is to ignore all that lines in the log, but keep all the other 
ones, by creating a new file called

/etc/rsyslog.d/01-chilli.conf

with only this line:

:msg, contains, "(Resource temporarily unavailable)" ~

After that any syslog request log, with that string just gets ignored and 
not logged to file, which is better than your /dev/null temporary solution.

You can still inspect syslog and try to catch the problem.

(waiting for more feedback on this)
