## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Vikram

The next minor release is being worked on at
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/commits/hotfix/3.8.1 and
you can see what has changed from the last release by going to
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/compare/3.8.0...hotfix/3.8.1

I don't currently have any details of a release date. I had been hoping to
get the new build system working, and push out new builds for all supported
distros. When I hit the snag that 16.04 can't currently be supported, I
shelved that idea for a little while, and then work and family has gotten
busy. My plan still is to automate the build process, build new apt
repositories and push out 3.8.1, it just needs to wait until I have the
time to do it.

Regards

Tim
