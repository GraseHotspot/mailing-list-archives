## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim

This the url to my result: https://paste.grasehotspot.org/view/b1a151d2

I notice their is some misconfig with Chilli or what, you can tell me
more what your findings. This just happened from yesterday and my
Ineternet speed drops dramatically. I really need your help as to what
should I have to do to fix this problem.

For one thing, here is a copy of my syscntl.conf

##
# /etc/sysctl.conf - Configuration file for setting system variables
# See /etc/sysctl.d/ for additonal system variables
# See sysctl.conf (5) for information.

#kernel.domainname = example.com

#kernel.printk = 3 4 1 3

# Uncomment the next line to enable TCP/IP SYN cookies

Here is my setup:

WAN side ome through MODEM - MANAGED SWITCH - ROUTER 1
(111.92.179.46/29) <--> LAN (192.168.x.x/24)

                                     MODEM - MANAGED SWITCH - GRASE
BOX (111.92.179.45) <--> LAN (10.1.x.x/24) ETH0 is facing the Internet
side while ETH1 ( with tun0 and tun1) is where grase resides.

Hope that helps you in  your troubleshooting.

Thanks you very much for your support and time.
