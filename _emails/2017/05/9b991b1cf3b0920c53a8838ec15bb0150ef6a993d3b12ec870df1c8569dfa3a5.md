## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I can't do the collection of support info, cuz the internet side doesnt 
work either.  The nic has a valid IP, but I am not getting any traffic to 
flow.  I can ping, but no dns, or http traffic by ip.

The restarting of dnsmasq fails while trying to create the listening socket 
on 172.19.0.1 as already in use.
