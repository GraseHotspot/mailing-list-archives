## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}HI all

I have been using squid without problems for almost 6 months now without 
any issues but yesterday the client are unable to connect. the ubuntu 14 
server was freezing after booting. Then today i did a memtest and the 
server is no longer freezing but the clients i are unable to connect. i 
checked the cached log i found the line bellow which i suspect as the root 
of the dilemna am facing.
