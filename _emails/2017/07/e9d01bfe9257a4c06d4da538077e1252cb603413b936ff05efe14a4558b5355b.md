## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thank you, Tim.

     The reason is because, in my job we have a server with Rethat, with 4
network interfases. We want implement a hotspot solution, and grase hotspot
is greate.  Our first option is implement the hotspot over redhat, because
we have some application deployed there.

    Thank for you quick answer.

Regards

Hi Carlos

We don't currently support anything other than Ubuntu or Debian. What is
your reason for needing to implement it over Redhat?
A core part of the Grase Hotspot is the integration of the components, and
that can only come with tight coupling to the packaging system (apt/dpkg
here). In the future we may be able to disconnect the components more,
allowing for other distributions to be supported, at the cost of a harder
setup.

Regards

Tim
