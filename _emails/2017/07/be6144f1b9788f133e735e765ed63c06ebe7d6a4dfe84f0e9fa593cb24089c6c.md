## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}That is generally bad idea and wrong approach.
Grase is pure network "component".  You should consider Grase as 
"router" at the first place which  it is.
It  should be separated from any other application. At least virtualised.
This is not just another  rule. For network administrators It is very 
clear why.

Once separated, you can forget Grase over RH implementation and go 
straight with Ubuntu which is another good side efect of the same rule.
