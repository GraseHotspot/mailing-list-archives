## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Sorry for the delay in response.

RADIUS is about restricting access, and the free login still uses RADIUS to
do exactly that. An open WiFi allows abuse. An open WiFi controlled by
Grase with Free Login allows you to restrict access, for example a daily
time limit, or bandwidth restrictions etc. You can also block a user who is
abusing the system.

For now, there isn't a nice way to remove the excess of users without
running some SQL. I've opened an issue (
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/170) to sort this
out. It's a simple fix, so hopefully I can do something in the next few
weeks.

Regards

Tim
