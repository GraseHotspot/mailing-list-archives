{% raw  %}Hi Daniel

This sounds like you might have an isolation issue. The WiFi on the Grase
Hotspot side, should have to go through the Grase server to be able to
access the "outside" network. By default, "inside" ip addresses can access
"outside" ip addresses, but in no way should be able to assign themselves
an outside IP address. If they do try, no traffic should flow, because the
Grase server will be trying to access them on the outside network, and any
access via the internet, will also not be trying to reach them behind the
Grase server.

Can you possibly draw a diagram as to how your hardware is wired, what IP
ranges are in use, and how you are seeing this "bypass" being done.

(If you are instead asking how to stop "inside" users from access resources
in the "outside" network without preventing internet access, then it's a
case of modifying the IP tables rules to masquerade to all addresses,
except the outside addresses. But based on your email, it doesn't sound
like that's your request).

Regards

Tim
