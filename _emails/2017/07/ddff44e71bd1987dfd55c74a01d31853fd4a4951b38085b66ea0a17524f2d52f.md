## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi.

If you are sure about the password, then you may use a php script to delete
old accounts. First you should install PhpMyAdmin. (sudo apt-get install
phpmyadmin)

In radius DB, there is two tables named "radcheck" and "radusergroup".
These are storing all users login information and groups.

In radcheck table, users' names and expiration infos are stored. Mac users
doesn't have expiration so it is hard to find / delete the old accounts. If
you add an extra timestamp field to the radcheck table, then you may easily
delete them by determining their register date. ( ALTER TABLE `radcheck`
ADD `registerdate` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP; )

A php script or a SQL script from PhpMyAdmin can handle the job. ( DELETE
FROM radcheck WHERE datediff(NOW()-registerdate)>30 ) => This sample query
will delete all accounts older than 30 days.

If you only want to delete the mac user then you you may use something like
this: ( DELETE FROM radcheck WHERE datediff(NOW()-registerdate)>30 AND
UserName LIKE '%-%' AND Value='password' )

Raspberry is very important for me. Easy implementation, cheap and easy to
find. My high score was 104 users using grase simultaneously.

​Thanks to Tim for everything...​
