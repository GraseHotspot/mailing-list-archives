## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}there are not that many users, but that many accounts. The system is set to 
allow 100 simultaneous and I don't think it ever comes near that but people 
come and sign in and the way it works is Grase creates a user based on the 
MAC address and because there is no expiry on the free access group (as I 
was advised) there are many unused user accounts in the DB
