thst much user traffic. ðŸ˜…

For this, usually i handle directly to the database itself. As addon my
server going along with grase, i installed phpmyadmin. Webmin is a good
addon too.

For extra tools other than above, i did installed ntopng (web base access),
nload, htop, ntop, jnettop and speedtest-cli (remote ssh monitoring tools).

Handy and useful in my opinion. ðŸ˜€

Hi again

I have had the latest version of my raspberry pi based hotspot running for
some time now. It is used entirely as free access so users just hit the
free access button and are online. The problem i have now is that as no
expiry should be set on that group I now have something like 32,000 users
on the system most of which will never bee seen again. If I try and go to
the users page it just hangs up due to the numbers.

I would like to purge the whole user database and start from scratch (the
only account that matters is my computer account for my phone). Obviously
even if I could get the users page to draw there is not a quick way to
delete that many accounts. I do have webmin installed so I was hoping to
use the mysql module to do the job although I realise this could be risky
however I cant access the module to to an account / credentials issue.
When I installed the system I used the same system password for all of the
mysql prompts to make it simple but this wont work with the webmin module.
I tried 'root' and 'ubuntu' as account names.

Can anyone suggest a way forward? and what is the best way to manage the
free access group where most users will never be seen after a few days on
holiday?

thanks in advance......
