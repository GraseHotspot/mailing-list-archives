## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Great job Tim. Changes saving well after the update. I noticed on Advanced 
Settings> password length, when i changed value to: passwordLength:4 ; 
usernameLength:4. The usernameLength is saving in the system but the 
password length is not updating changes. Is this a bug or can't be changed 
to less than 7or 8. The system is making vouchers with with password length 
of 7 & 8 randomly.

Regards
Louis
