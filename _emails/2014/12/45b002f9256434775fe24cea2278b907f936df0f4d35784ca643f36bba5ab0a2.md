## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello John,

My name is Stan and I live in Louisville Ky. We use Grase for coffee shops
in and around the city and found the exact same frustration as you. We made
some custom changes and fixed the issue. If you like, we can send you the
same config files and you can customize your setup.

Minor adjustments have to be made from one release to the next. As long as
you police your updates well, you shouldn't have any issues.

Let me know.

Sincerely,

Stan C.
