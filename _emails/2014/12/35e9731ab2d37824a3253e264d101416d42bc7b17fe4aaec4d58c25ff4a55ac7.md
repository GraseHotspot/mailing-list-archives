## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Bob,

dhcpend is correct since it is a count starting from first IP (10.1.0.0) 
which means dhcpend 299 is the IP 10.1.1.43. An easier way to calculate 
this would be to have each entire subnet assigned to each site:

Site 1 (Master): dhcpstart 2 dhcpend 254 (range 10.1.0.1 -> 10.1.0.254)
Site 2 (Slave): dhcpstart 257 dhcpend 510 (range 10.1.1.1 -> 10.1.1.254)
Site 3 (Slave): dhcpstart 513 dhcpend 766 (range 10.1.2.1 -> 10.1.2.254)
Site 4 (Slave): dhcpstart 769 dhcpend 1022 (range 10.1.3.1 -> 10.1.3.254)
....

The rule is: Next Site will start 3 hosts away from last one and end 253 
hosts away from start
This way Chillispot IP is always 10.1.0.1 and  we can easily identify which 
sites the clients belong to.

Before coming up with this solution I used a different method assigning 
different networks to each site (Master = 10.1.0.0/24, Slave 1 = 
10.1.1.0/24 ....) this means each Chillispot would have a different IP 
which means it is harder to do because involves more modifications to 
original code and I don't think it worth it.

Next thing to do in order to solve Development Issue #56 is to add a new 
menu in Grase admin to manage and customise the remote sites and modify 
portal page to identify and adapt to each site, including different logos, 
Names, etc... also ticket printing could be adapted to reflect each site 
information.

Regarding to DD-WRT Routers, I use for testing D-Link Dir-615 (hardware 
version H2) And Netgear WNDR3700 V4 for the remote sites.
WNDR3700 can support hundreds of concurrent users.

Regards,

Norberto
