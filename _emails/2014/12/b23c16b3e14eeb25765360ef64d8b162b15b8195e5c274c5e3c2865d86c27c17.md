Not sure. It depends of particular router, model-hardware version and 
memory capacity. Recently I flash TP-link 74x something.. (can't find 
right model right now). It was neccesseary to find out exact firmware, 
but none of chilly or radius components installed by default. It is 
neccesseary to do it manually. In fact I am not sure if memory will suffice.
In contrary, my previous installation on Linksys WRT 54GL results with 3 
different portals Coova included and many other goodies.

Since Liksys is a legend but kind of outdate hardware (54Mbps only), it 
is normal today that we are choosing 150 and 300 Mbps models. They gives 
better signal/distance but also more concurrent users.

So, my suggestion is to study carefully openwrt or DDwrt hardware 
compability tables as well other available informations regarding 
flashing certain models, before purchasing.
Additionaly , makers today often making plenty hardware versions on same 
model, so you can never be sure which version you will get when buying 
online. Differences between hw versions are minor but sometimes are drastic.
