## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I would take off the >> /home/network.txt and ensure you have mail setup,
as then Cron will capture the output and email it to you.

Alternatively, you need to ensure you catch both stderr and stdout, by
default you are just capturing stdout.

See http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-3.html

Having said all that, you'll probably find that restarting networking won't
fix a faulty card, as often its a card lockup which needs the usb to be
reset (unplugged and plugged back in)
