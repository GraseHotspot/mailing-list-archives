## Raw message

I've created an issue for this. It shouldn't be too hard to implement. I'd
probably make it a couple of settings, which can make the username just
lowercase letters, and probably 2 levels for simple passwords, just
numbers, and numbers with lowercase letters.

There is already settings for length, it's just not quite what you expect,
as it's not a fixed length, rather a setting that controls the approximate
length.
