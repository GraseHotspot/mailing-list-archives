## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Norberto,

Thanks so much for your efforts. This looks like it might solve Development
Issue #56 https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/56
<https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/56>

One issue I noticed with your tutorial...
Shouldn't "dhcpend 299" really read  "dhcpend 255"?

Also I think that standard openwrt based CoovaAP firmware (
http://coova.org/CoovaAP ) should work out of the box as client access
controller.

Cheers,

Bob
