{% raw  %}Hi Benny

What hardware are you using?

I've done numerous tests regarding speed as I noticed a few years ago it
was slower than I expected. The conclusion I came to is that depending on
the hardware you are running it on well vary the speed. We have a 25Mbps
connection, and on a virtual machine and on a Cubietruck I get ~25Mbps
through the hotspot. I did find a few years ago when I tried to use a
Guruplug (pogoplug) that it didn't have the grunt needed. However, it
shouldn't need a really a huge amount of grunt, and given that my
Cubietruck can push 25Mbps without a problem, you should be able to do
better than 400Kbps.

Regards

Tim
