## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}
Is it possible to deploy grase on routed networks? I'm thinking it should 
still WORK but i want to make sure.



Example

Internet ------> Grase (10.10.0.X)--------->Network A (192.168.0.X)------>> 
Network C(192.168.100.X)
                                           |------------>Network B 
(172.16.0.X) ------->> Network D (172.16.2.X)

Assuming there are routers between the different network legs, and all 
routes are known/set statically or otherwise.


When i say WORK I'm also referring to the system being able to provide auth 
to all clients. I'm thinking that the Machine clients might not work seen 
that MAC addresses gets replaced during routing. what would be a workable 
solution for this?


Also is there any possibility of having a billing module?

I was thinking that maybe having some form of PPPOE to authenticate against 
the user database.....??
