{% raw  %}@Elliot
I can see more clear now.
Well, how I see weakness here is that 722n and that wireless connection 
to 1043.
Although you got that working, 1043 radio will be quite busy talking to 
many sides.
How about usb-to-ethernet adapter. You will get wired LAN side.
I had post here before, don't know how to link it. Title was "An idea 
for Grase hardware".
Here I have link to some photos:

Hope this may help you.
