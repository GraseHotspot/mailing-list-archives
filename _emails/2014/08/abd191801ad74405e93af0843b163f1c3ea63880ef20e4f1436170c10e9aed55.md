## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Having trouble lately with one specific remote wifi link.

I have AP say A, connected to grase lan. This AP accepting local clients 
nearby. They can connect grase normally and get internet access as 
expected. (AirLink AirMax2 outdoor device)

There is remote radio device B set as bridge or client mode and client 
PC wired to B. (TP link WR702N with Yagi)

PC---wire---C-------------2.4GHz-------------A---wire---Grase

PC or wired tablet cannot access grase so can't login nor get IP.
If those devices are added as computer account by their Eth. Mac they 
can pick up IP from Chilli and I can see them connected at "Monitor 
sessions" page.

However, neither can go internet, they can't even ping grase. They can 
ping both A and B radios.

I am bit confused here. Or those little radio toys don't do full 
bridging or something else on grase side changed.
Any idea?
