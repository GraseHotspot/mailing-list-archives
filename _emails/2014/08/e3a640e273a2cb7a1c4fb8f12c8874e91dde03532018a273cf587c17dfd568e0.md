## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Eliot,
"...Ubuntu 12.04
Atom 330 with 1x eth giga
1x usb tp-link 722n ( recognized and working ok ) .."

guess this above is your Grase hardware.
Can you connect your PC/NB by wire to Grase LAN and test that is 
everything working  OK?

Next step would be setting of 1043/OpenWRT. Your should set router LAN 
as static IP from 10.1.0.0 range. Disable DHCP. Disable router WAN port. 
Set working mode as AP.  Go trough all OpenWRT settings and disable any 
unecessary option. Specially if any QOS or restrictions active at 1043 
itself.
Connect LAN port No1. of 1043 by wire to grase box.
Try wireless client and check connection properties. IP, Gateway, DNS if 
all received correctly.

Regarding static IP of router , you should change Chilly  DHCP range . 
E.g. set lower end to 10.1.0.20, then use addresses bellow that for 
static addresses.
