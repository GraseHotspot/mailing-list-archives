## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Atom that converted to server is this one
http://archive.benchmarkreviews.com/?option=com_content&task=view&id=359&Itemid=69&limitstart=4
As you may see there is no space - no slot except usb.

Mainboard nic is connected to wan ( in my case sagem 1704 )
Usb ethernet is connected to LAN / AP 1043ND

Of course usb is much different than real nic, but it works without any lag 
or delay.
I also test with usb wifi adapter but busy and delay results

The above 1043 is set up as AP+WDS and the other devices are client to this.
I test speed and its no loose 100%
Depends bandwidth limits from grase, no limit on grase is comming out full 
speed of xdsl.

Tested and working 100% as personal use and as massive load with in 50 
users at same time on.
