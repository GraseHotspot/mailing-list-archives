## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hi Eliot,
Why not use add-on NIC card into your Atom board usb instead? PCI or 
PCIe if any.
This USB-to-Eth adapter is not very capable thing. My advice was using 
it with old notebook which usually don't have second NIC. Besides I got 
it not working at full speed with oldie (10Mb/s only) due to low USB 
version guess.
With new APs with n+ wireless mode with 150Mb/s and up, even adapter 
which works up to 100 may become bottle neck. If you have more than one 
AP on LAN side and many clients this may slow overall speed. Although 
internet speed may be lower that that, still there is a lot of LAN only 
traffic.
I noticed that some APs maintains lot of client connections, those 
clients are not registered Grase users. People, just see open network 
and trying to connect, What they did, means getting IP and staying 
connected with AP.

Thumb up for your equipment. I did flashed TPlink 741nd with Gargoyle 
firmware too. Seems nice firmware.
