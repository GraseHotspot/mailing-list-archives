## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Darren

I don't get to the mailing list as much as I'd like.

It sounds like you are editing the config directly. The config file is
overridden by the Grase package. However you should be able to edit it.
Permission denied sounds like you are running Chilli as a user that does't
have permission to those areas. The Chilli packages I make specifically run
Chilli as root, otherwise it's prone to break.

You can also use MySQL to return SOME chilli attributes back to Chilli at
startup, which should include static ip's.

Can you show us the changes you have tried making, and what you intend them
to do?

Tim
