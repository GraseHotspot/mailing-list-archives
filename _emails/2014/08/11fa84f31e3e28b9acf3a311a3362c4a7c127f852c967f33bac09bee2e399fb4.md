## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Ok @drazen thank you for reply.
Grase machine as you see based on atom 330 with 1x ethernet internal 
connected direct to xdsl modem
So no other space to add second card in this mini mainboard, except usb
So i add an 722n tp-link in a usb port and recognized as wlan0 on grase.

No the hard stuff.
Modem - router - ap is a 1043nd with in openwrt 12.09 modified
I disable in : LAN - WAN - DHCP and leave it as ap with ip 10.1.0.0 and no 
encryption.

722n usb see it and connected auto and give ip 10.1.0.1
Grase is now on ip 10.1.0.20
I give on grase ip range 100 - 200, and make tests with my xperia android 
and a laptop that i got.
Looking ok, connected with the login screen, and logout.

So ip ranges was the problem. SOLVED
Next step is to connect ap with another 2 client routers - paired mac adr 
and wds modes to cover signal.
I will post tests soon
