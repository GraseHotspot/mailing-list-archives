## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Problem solved.
To get remote link working, the key was in enabling AP+WDS at the base 
station. However, WDS was not working as expected at AirMax2 station. 
So, I used TP-link WR-741nd, tweaked for outdoor use, but having same 
WDS problem. Then I flash it with Gargoyle firmware which is build on 
top of OpenWRT. There is much more flexiblity in setting then original 
TP link firmware.
Gargoyle is interesting firmware with many options restricting access. 
We don't really need it with Grase but someone may wish to take a look:
