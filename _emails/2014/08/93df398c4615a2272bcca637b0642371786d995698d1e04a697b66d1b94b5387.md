I see also a typical error on squid setup.
In my case i also install webmin and a lot of addons with stress free theme.

Squid not caching at default setup so, need this:
In /etc/squid3/squid.conf uncomment 
cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid3 100 16 256

100 is the cache that squid use, change to what you need and restart

Another problem is that not everything on the web has cache friendly expire 
tags, and the refresh patterns by default are somewhat conservative.
Adding this line to /etc/squid3/squid.conf can help. 

refresh_pattern -i \.(gif|png|jpg|jpeg|ico)$ 3600       90%     43200

This will force squid to cache all the images listed above for at least and 
hour, and up to half a day. 

More info about squid at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Squid

Before any change keep squid.conf as a backup, just in case
