## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I had started a mockup for a payment gateway "wizard". I'm not overly happy
with it.

Look at the purchase_wizard.php file in the radmin folder of git. There is
a payment gateway folder as well with a dummy gateway. The idea being you'd
turn that into a Paypal gateway.
