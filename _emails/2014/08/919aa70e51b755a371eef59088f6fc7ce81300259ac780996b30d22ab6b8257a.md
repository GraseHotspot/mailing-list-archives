## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I had a similar problem and it kept recurring until I reedited my
/etc/hosts and it worked. If you read the error message you will realise it
is having a problem initializing eth1 or the port chilli is going to create
tun0 on. The interface is not coming up and thus tun0 cannot be started.
Thus it cannot write to /var/run. In your case it could be related to how
you have configured and bridged your network interface and the virtualbox
interface. Try to see which interfaces are up.

Thanks,
Lucas
