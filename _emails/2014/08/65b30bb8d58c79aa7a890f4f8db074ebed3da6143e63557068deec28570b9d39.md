## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Edward

The Coova Chilli module that we use to do the captive portal, can be done
in Layer 3 mode, where your routers do all the DHCP etc, and the Coova
Chilli just does Layer 3 routing. The way I have it setup with the Grase
Hotspot is in the default Layer 2 routing instead. I've not played with the
Layer 3 routing, and unfortunately don't have the time.

I'm also not going to have any time to write a billing module, however
feature branches from the git repository are welcome, if you have the
skills to implement one.

Tim
