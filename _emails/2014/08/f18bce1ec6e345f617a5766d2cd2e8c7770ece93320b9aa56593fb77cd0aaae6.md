## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi All, 

I was trying to remember if I had seen anyone using Grase with PayPal or another payment gateway. 

I did a search on GitHub and don't seem to be able to do a search on the webpage. 

Google got me here http://grasehotspot.org/2012/03/26/development-delay/

There was a comment from Tim saying that it had been started but laking available time back in April 2013. 


Has anyone made this work? or 
What would be needed to get it happening?


Regards 
Dave 

{% endraw %}
