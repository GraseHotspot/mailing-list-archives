## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Sheldon

This sounds like it could be a MTU issue. Check that the MTU Grase is
setting on the tun0 device, and all the interfaces is correct.
Also, check that it's not CPU limited. On a lower powered machine the
traffic accounting can slow things down.

I just did a quick test on the stable version, in a VM and had no problems.

Have you checked the settings between the 2 VM environments? Does the
Ubuntu VM work fine in the production environment when used as a drop in
replacement for Grase?

Tim
