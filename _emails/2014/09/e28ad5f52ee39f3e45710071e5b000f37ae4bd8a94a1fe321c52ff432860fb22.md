## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}For this operation network topology or better say , network services 
need to play this role should be located differently.
For any controled network access two things are essential. So called NAC 
(Network access controler) and AAA (authentication, authorization and 
accounting)

Client talk to NAC, NAC talk to AAA then NAC allow or reject client.
In Grase, NAC is Chilli, AAA is radius, both in same box.

In remote scenario, every remote AP have to has own NAC which can talk 
to remote radius.
Besides, radius location should be accessible from internet by DDNS or 
public and static IP.

In theory, any AP device which has radius authentification built-in own 
firmware can talk to remote radius and do NAC function. Ussually most of 
AP devices don't have full AAA built in, then authentification only. And 
this is all at radio level. No splash/landing page.

For this purpose it is common to use devices with OpenWRT or similar 
firmware which usually has own Splash portal or chilli as option.
Each AP/NAC have to do local DHCP too.

At radius side, some diferent configuration should be implemented. Each 
remote AP have to be declared by its MAC with radius. This way radius 
will talk with known APs only. Each AP then can have different 
accounting options or not.

And finnaly there is a question of user database, which usually can be 
anywhere but, it is normally at same box where radius reside. (For 
limited traffic of course.)
... how about proxing and traffic records if asked?

So, according to this very basic requests, Grase as is now can't handle 
remote access. Quite a lot reprogram should be done, and it can't call 
Grase anymore.

Hope this can help understanding.
Please anybody feel free to correct me or add more
