## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Yes that is what I am talking about. When card is not there!
However, Tim, I am curious how do you deal with 
"PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames" introduced with latest kernel. I 
don't know if Ubuntu 14 already has that. I guess that this has a quite 
influence at the Grase installation in the future. Maybe you should let 
users enter which card will do what at early phase of installation 
before network setting takes a place.
There is a lot of reactions from community on that novelty which breaks 
traditional linux naming eth0, eth1,...
