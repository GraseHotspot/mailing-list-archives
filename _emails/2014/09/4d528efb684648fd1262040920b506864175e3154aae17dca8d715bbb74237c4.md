## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Why you need to restart anything?

There is easy way of using static addressing.  Narow Chilli  DHCP from 
lower side e.g. "DHCP Start 20" and place your APs here, Give them 
static addresses. This way you can access them anytime from radio side 
or wired to set them up, reboot or whatever and most important they will 
never mess anything in dynamic range.

In fact APs can have any static addrress out of subnet and still will do 
the job. They will be not accessible this way.
