## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}First of all, thanks for the reply and taking the time to suggest other 
similar options.

I guess I was a quite a bit vague in my explanation earlier, so let me 
expand on that first. The reason I would like to have multiple captive 
portals is, to have different types of access displayed at some locations, 
as well as different settings for said types of access. Now, yeah, the 
access type with a username and password can easily be solved by creating 
different kinds of users and or groups. However, I would like to have, for 
example a captive portal that offers username + password access as well as 
a free 15 minutes access button, then another one which offers again 
username + password access, as well as a free 1 hour access button, etc. 
So, the problem here is, two different captive portals as well as different 
settings for the same function (15min free vs 1h free /day). In a way, I 
would need some kind of captive portal profiles, if you get my drift.

I believe I could achieve this by running two servers, however what I'm 
wondering is, if it's somehow possible to have it all-in-one, i.e. in one 
instance of Grase.

Thanks for your time!

Marko
