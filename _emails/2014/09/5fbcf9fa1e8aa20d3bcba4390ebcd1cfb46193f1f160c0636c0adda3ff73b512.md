## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Bob

And upgrade to 3.7.7.11 will clear the radpostauth table. (There was a bug
in older versions that caused it to grow too big, so the upgrade truncates
it). Check that you are also running the latest grase-conf-freeradius for
the radpostauth table to work.

For patches, on Github you can fork the repository, commit your changes
(you'll want the production branch) and the submit a pull request. Ideally,
you'd branch off production for your patches, and then submit the pull
request from that branch.

Tim
