## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I think for various reasons this was a good feature and I also agree it could be taken out. However I would lobby for a non techie option to be provided that is linked on the login page.  This option could possibly provide a page 2 that provides the downloads. These downloads would be added/uploaded/removed through the admin portal and the link auto created on page 2.

This is useful if you use a regular non tech clerk to administer the portal area.{% endraw %}
