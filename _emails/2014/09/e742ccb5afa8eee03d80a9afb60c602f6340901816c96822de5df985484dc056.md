It should work. Just not tested so your results may vary.

I've not played with Coova Chilli as Layer 3. In theory, if it was Layer 3,
dnsmasq could handle the DHCP. If the problem is your AP's ip addresses,
you can give them "fixed" IP's using RADIUS, I'll have to try and find more
details on that though. The better option though for AP's is to have them
static on a different subnet, so clients can't easily connect to their
admin interface.
How often do you restart the server or coova chilli. Normally, a restart is
handled rather well, with any active clients IP's being "retained" for them
as long as traffic is still flowing. (Coova Chilli detects the traffic, and
internally does a DHCP lease so it matches where the traffic is coming
from, at least that's been my experience, I didn't write coova chilli so
could be wrong). I'd aim to restart as few times as possible, and then it
wouldn't be such a big issue.

When I get time, I intend to try and get Layer 3 working as an option.
