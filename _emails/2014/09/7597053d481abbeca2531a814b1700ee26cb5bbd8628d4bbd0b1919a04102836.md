## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Assuming you are wanting to update to the latest version without going to
the nightlies, and that you've install the grase-repo package.
Run
"sudo apt-get update"
"sudo apt-get upgrade"
If there are any new updates, it'll install them, the key is to look for
the grase- packages.

If you are wanting to go from stable to nightly, currently you'll need to
to do a fresh install as the nightly won't run on Ubuntu older than 14.04
and the stable version doesn't yet run on 14.04.
