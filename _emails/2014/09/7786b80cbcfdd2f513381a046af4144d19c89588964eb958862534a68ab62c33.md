## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thanks for the response Tim. I tried stopping the squid service and i was
able to get access to a few websites but for most w websites i would get
browser error that says it can't connect. I tried starting it again and it
didn't return any errors. I commented out the two lines from chilli ipup.sh
script(Redirect to Squid proxy) and restarted the chilli service and it
seems to be working. I tried stopping the squid service and then accessing
many websites and all of them was showing without any problem. I checked
the logview page and didn't see any sign off traffic logs. So i guess it
does what i want. I've been using this for the past few hours and there
seems to be no problem. Is it a good solution Tim? Does this make any
problems in future or at all?
Thanks
