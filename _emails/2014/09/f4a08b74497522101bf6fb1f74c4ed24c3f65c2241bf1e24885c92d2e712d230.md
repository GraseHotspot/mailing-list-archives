{% raw  %}Hi Mohammad

In theory, this is easy to implement. In practice, getting it right is
harder. It's something I'm hoping I can get implemented well in the near
future. It's fairly "easy" to implement if all vouchers expire within a
month of first, usage, however, due to how we "compact" the accounting data
each month, it's harder for longer expiries. I'm hoping for a 2 pronged
approach, where at first login we can get the correct expiry dynamically,
but a script will run regularly and update the dynamic expiry to a static
one so it can span more than a month.

Tim
