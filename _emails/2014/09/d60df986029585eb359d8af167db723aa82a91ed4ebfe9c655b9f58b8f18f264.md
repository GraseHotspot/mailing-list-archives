## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}You can do that with one server, one captive portal and one AP.
In this application there are no any recognition of APs from server 
side. They are all transparent/invisible to server. So you can't achieve 
what you asked for on the way you described..

However, you can create user/group without limits and charge. It is 
consider as free access too. Still captive portal is there, but access 
is free in this scenario. User have to enter username and password.

Also you can use Grase and create "machine" accounts using MAC address 
of client devices. Still you can set limitations and charge, or you can 
leave it without. No captive at all in this case. Acces is free or non 
free for machines you register previously.

If you wish to offer free access without username/password and captive 
portal, you only need AP without any credentials or security. Just plug 
it directly to your internet router/modem. You don't need Grase at all.
Hope this help.
