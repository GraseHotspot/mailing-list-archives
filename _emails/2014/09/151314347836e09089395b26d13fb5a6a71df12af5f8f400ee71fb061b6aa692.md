See other email to list about POC version.

Currently I believe the code  deletes accounts that have expired more than
1 month ago. See CronFunctions.class.php, the deleteExpiredUsers function.
You can just modify the months array to have users stay around longer (but
your changes will probably be overwritten on each package update). Not sure
the easiest way to make this customisable. Feel free to submit an issue on
github and I'll think about it.

Can you also give me an example of how to customize the login portal for

Look at the Portal Customisation page in the Radmin portal. Just start
playing with adding CSS, and modifying the HTML around the login form. Most
of the customisations you'll want to make are CSS based. Unfortunately I
can't help you, but worst case you clear the "Main CSS" field and turn off
the "Disable all default CSS" checkbox and it should be mostly back to
normal.
