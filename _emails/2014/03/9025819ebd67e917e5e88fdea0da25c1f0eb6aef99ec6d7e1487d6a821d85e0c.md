## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thanks Tim,  I created a group with a recurring limit of 250Mb per day.  For one user two devices logged in and ended up using 250Mb each so a total of 500Mb was used.

It does not appear to be rolling over after midnight.  The user is still in the "Out of Quota" group and has not cleared the used data quota (500.24Mb). Is there a command to force the rollover?

Thanks for your help,
Derek

I'll explain as best I can

Worst case, say 10 people login simultaneously at the start of the day, then all 10 people could use a full 250mb.
Say someone logs in and uses 100, then someone else logs in, the second person could use 150 while the first could still use the full 250.

Basically, at login it calculates how much the user has left, and allows that session to use the remainder. Each session constantly reports back how much has been used, so new sessions will be limited even if existing sessions are still going.

The rollover is midnight.

Hi,  We have a Group setup with a recurring data limit of 250Mb.  I would like to know what happens if you set the Simultaneous login to "yes".  I understand that they may use more than the 250Mb but I am OK with that.  I just wanted to know if it will affect anything else.  For example if they use 500Mb will it still reset for the following day.  Also does it reset at midnight or does it reset from when they used up all their quote?

Any assistance will be appreciated

Regards,
Derek
