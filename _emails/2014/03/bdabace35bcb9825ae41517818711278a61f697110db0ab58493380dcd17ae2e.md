## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi all,
I just installed grase and get the installation done like in the 
dokumentation, till the point, where it says, that I now can connect to the 
webinterface.
I didn't get it to work. I am using ubuntu server 13.10 which is connected 
to our router with eth0. On the other port I connected my lapop directly at 
eth1 and the connection seems to work because my laptop gets a ip addr. But 
I am not able to connect to the webinterface. Is there any way to control 
grase without the webinterface, and is there a way to connect "from the 
other side" so via eth0?
Sorry for my english, but I think it is clear what is the problem.
I hope someone can help me.

{% endraw %}
