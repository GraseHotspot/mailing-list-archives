Why didn't you just follow the install doc and use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server 
? That just works... I just did an install for the first time a few days 
back and it worked fine. Just do a basic LAMP install and follow 
instructions !

I'm not sure directly connecting you laptop is the right thing to do. Run 
it via a switch.

Check your ip configuration as well.

Regarding access from the WAN side, read the install doc again. In the 
comments is this though I am not sure if it currently applies, but guess it 
does :

"Easiest way is to port forward port 80 to your hotspot machine (you can 
port forward an alternative port like 5678 as long as it points to 80 on 
the hotspot machine). Just make sure you secure the server to allow access 
from limited ip addresses."
