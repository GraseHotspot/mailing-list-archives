## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}It's currently a work in progress. If you are brave, you can build the
grase-www-portal package from the git code
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/
Then it's just a matter of finding the setting called "Free Login Group"
and putting a group name there.

I plan on making the whole login process much better in the near future,
I've just not had time to merge in the code from a private project. Part of
this will be a revamp of how the freelogin works allowing us to present a
TOS page instead of a login page.
