## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I think you'll have to edit each user in that specific group and fill the *Account 
Lock Reason* field so they can't log in.  I don't see any setting in the 
*Groups* category that lets you lock users in a specific group in one go.  
When you delete a group, you only delete settings for that group, as well 
as its name, so it no longer appears in the list of choices when you create 
or edit users.  Accounts that were created under that group before you 
delete the group retain the group name.  This is for display purposes only 
when you look at the *Users* category.  If you don't want to see the 
deleted group's name in the *Users* category, either move them under 
another group or delete those users.
{% endraw %}
```
