## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Nestor

It sounds like your Wireless AP is actually a router. You need a "dumb"
access point, that just does Layer 2, and not Layer 3. Often if you turn
off the DHCP server on the Wireless AP, that's enough. You may also find
that your Wireless AP has LAN and WAN ports, turn off DHCP and plug
everything into the LAN ports leaving the WAN port empty.
