I thought it should pick it up from the repo but show unsatisfied deps
when it tries to install ?

Ahhhh. it's picked it up now. Complains about no smarty3 but you can use

sudo apt-get -f install to force it.

I'll have a look for a smarty3 deb - couldn't find one before - but my
poor eyesight is legendary ;-)

Seems that all the Quantal 12.10 repos have gone - maybe someone knows
where there are old ones ?

Just tried the Trusty 14.04 version 3.1.13 which seems to install OK

http://pkgs.org/ubuntu-14.04/ubuntu-universe-i386/smarty3_3.1.13-1_all.deb.html

Will test later.

Cool - will test

KK - I think before it directed you to the page you were after or gave
you a link to it - that would be good. People are dumb and will just sit
and wait expecting something to happen !

Yes, that would be good - I think it is important they can get back to
the page easily when/if they need too.

Mobile Opera. I think it proxies everything off them to help speed it
up, and I can't see a way to disable it. I'll try and have a look at
what it is doing.

A quick Google (should have done it before) for "Request exceeded the
limit of 10 internal redirects due to probable configuration error"
reveals it is usually a problem with .htaccess

e.g.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19071324/request-exceeded-the-limit-of-10-internal-redirects

"Is most likely re-injecting a changed request URI over and over again
which could cause such an internal redirect error."

Needs a small change to .htaccess to prevent looping.

Not my speciality (what is ?!)

Sorry - should have done that - my bad

Currently on

grase-www-portal:
  Installed: 3.7.7.6.95.ga83c6bc
  Candidate: 3.7.7.6.95.ga83c6bc

Will try the new version in a while.
