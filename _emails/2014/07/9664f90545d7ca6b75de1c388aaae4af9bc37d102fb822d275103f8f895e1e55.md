## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello Tim,

I would like to thank you first of all for this amazing pieceof software 
that has helped me a lot.  

We are using grase in a hotel that has two different networks. One is a lan 
service that we offer to the customers for free. We have a grase server 
running and controlling access to the lan connected users to enable 
restrictions and access management. On the WiFi, we are using a zyxel 
router with a little thermal printer that creates its own hotspot service, 
one we charge the customers for. Since we have come to really appreciate 
the brilliance of grase we would like to turn the WiFi service over to 
grase. The only concern is the fact that I do not know how the tickets for 
the paying customers will be printed. I need to be able to create a ticket 
that has some information about the connection credentials and also the 
time restrictions that apply to each account. 

Is there a way that this can be achieved? 

Thank you very much.

Nick
