## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi all,

I have a new GRASE install on a VMWare ESXi server. In our lab, it works 
great! All upload/download works. But on our production box, we are seeing 
uploads stalling out for clients. 

Uploads will start out fast -- a few megabits atleast, per our connection - 
but will drop down to zero very quickly. This issue is so bad that speed 
tests don't even complete - they get stuck on the upload portion. That 
said, all web browsing works fine (i imagine because smaller packets for 
simply requesting web traffic). 

Has anyone seen this? I'm not even particularly sure where to start 
debugging. I've enabled Chillispot debugging, but don't see any obvious 
error messages in the output. Uploads via scp from the grase server work 
fine. I have also created a client VM on the same box -- just to eliminate 
any physical layer issues. I see the same issue on the vSwitch. 

Any assistance or direction is appreciated!

{% endraw %}
