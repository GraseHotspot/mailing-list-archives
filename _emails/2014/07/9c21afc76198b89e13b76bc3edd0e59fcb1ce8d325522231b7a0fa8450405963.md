## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Sorry for the early update -- I should mention:

1. This is the newest version of GRASE (non-nightly) on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
2. There are no speed limits or data restrictions on the pgroups.
3. I have another Ubuntu 12.04 VM just doing DHCP and NAT via iptables, 
which works fine.
