## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi John

If you checkout the git version of grase-www-portal (
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal) You'll see a folder
called files. In that is the structure that gets unpacked. Overwrite the
installed files with the files from git, focusing on the
/usr/share/grase/www directory (
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/tree/master/files/usr/share/grase/www).
I actually just symlink /usr/share/grase/www to my git checkout when
developing. You may still have to fix some file permissions, in particular
the following commands from the postinst

chmod a+rw -R /usr/share/grase/www/images/logo.png /usr/share/grase/www
/radmin/templates_c /usr/share/grase/www/uam/templates_c

Feedback on the login form is appreciated

Tim
