## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi, thanks for the very quick response. 

First I download the version ubuntu-12.04.4-server-i386.iso, install it 
from a USB stick, and follow the installation steps that are in the page 
GreaseHotspot.org, The hotspot is working perfectly for several days 
without restart the server, there comes a time where for any reason I have 
to restart the computer, when the computer turn on I find that is not 
working the hotspot, researching even more, I realize that the Chilli 
service does not start and I appears the error described above, the command 
I use to manually start the chilli is sudo /etc/inid.d/chilli start..

We investigate what programs are installed and appear both versions 1.0 and 
0.8.9 installed of libssh
