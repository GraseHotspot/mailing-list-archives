## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi nazanin,

I operate a mesh network which does what you want, using Grase as the
gateway/server.

The Village Telco "Small Enterprise / Campus Network" (SECN) firmware uses
the B.A.T.M.A.N.-ADV  MAC-layer mesh protocol to create a virtual Layer 2
bridge over the entire mesh. For more info please see
http://villagetelco.org/get-started/choosing-a-firmware-for-the-mp/

You can download firmware images for some routers (tplink & ubiquiti) but
its possible to set this up on any openwrt router by installing the
batman-adv package and doing correct config (I have a bash script to set up
new nodes after flashing openwrt).

Regards,

Bob
