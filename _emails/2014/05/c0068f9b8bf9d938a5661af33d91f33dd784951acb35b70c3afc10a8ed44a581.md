I think you may end up needing more advanced code here.

Normally, at any time of the day, the code will return midnight of the
current day.  With your modified code, it'll return lunch time of the
current day. However, that will be in the future for the first 12 hours of
the day, which may cause issues, I'm not sure.

The actually query that is run is
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-conf-freeradius/blob/master/freeradius/perl_modules/sqlcounter.conf#L33
SELECT SUM(acctinputoctets - GREATEST((%b - UNIX_TIMESTAMP(acctstarttime)),
0))+ SUM(acctoutputoctets -GREATEST((%b - UNIX_TIMESTAMP(acctstarttime)),
0)) FROM radacct WHERE username='%{%k}' AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP(acctstarttime) +
acctsessiontime > '%b'"
The %b is replaced with the timestamp that the function above returns.

It's been along time since I worked on this code, but I think you may find
that if %b is in the future it may have issues.

Its not something I have time to test, but those 2 locations are where you
should be looking. Run some test queries with different timestamps and see
what happens.

Good Luck

Tim
