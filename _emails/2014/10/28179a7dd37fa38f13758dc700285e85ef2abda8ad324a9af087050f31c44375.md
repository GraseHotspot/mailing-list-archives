## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}This question was answered several times already.
Answer is NO.
Grase can control traffic at its LAN network only. Captive portal is 
part of Chilly which is integral part.
Timothy promised that he will develop that option in future, but nothing 
so far.

Basic thing what should be achieved is set radius to listen on all IPs, 
and also MAC addresses of each remote AP should be registered with 
radius. In such case, APs are not pure APs but NAS (Network Access 
controllers) . Typically famous lynksys wrt54 with openwrt firmware and 
covachilli installed at.
Remote NAS with own chilly will act as captive portal and will do AAA to 
radius. Oh yes there is a MySql yet which also need to be set to listen 
certain IPs and maybe some more.
This is a lot of work to make this working. It is also necessary to 
design webmin interface to manage all that centrally.

You can look at daloradius and ciitix (basically the same things). with 
these you need AP devices which can talk to radius, they will act as NAs 
but without captive portal. Clients will need to authenticate at the 
WIFi level, but basically you can achieve what you asked for, almost out 
of box.
The catch is that there is no or little "how to" out of installation. 
Daloradius author selling a book with instructions. But there is no 
everything you will need for advanced setup.

Hope this help
