## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Tim, there is a catch with your solution.
If many clients trying, how you can be sure that you are taking right MAC?
If there are many phones around, with WIFi On, devices trying to connect 
better signal automatically, even those are not your clients. I saw this 
already at my AP-s "active connections" page, shows tens of connections, 
but few only which are real clients.
Using username is 100% precise thing. I have special user created for this.
