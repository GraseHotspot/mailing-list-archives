## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}It is worth to mention here another wierd situation similar to above.
I have one grase installation on 12.0x Ubuntu where grase automatic 
updates stopped a year ago at the version 3.7.7.6
After watching carefully what manual updates output says, somwhere 
between those "unmet depedencies" and "not installable packets" find out 
"not enough space".

The problem was that by initial installation of Ubuntu,  system partion 
200Mb created. This is where all system and update packages go. After 
some time this partition getting full.
One solution is to clean up all update initial packages which are not 
neccesseary once instaled or updated. But in my case that was not 
enough. Had no time to investigate the problem till end. But bassically 
that partition should be extended. This is known issue with ubuntu.
