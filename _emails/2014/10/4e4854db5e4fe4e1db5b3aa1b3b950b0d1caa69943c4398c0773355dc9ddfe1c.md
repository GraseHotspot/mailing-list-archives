## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}hi Tim
Besides your effort to generate printing of vouchers directly from Grase 
pages, I still believe that combination of Office and users database may 
be convenient for some cases. I am trying to connect radius directly 
without exporting to CSV as I mention in my post earlier.
For that I need connection to radius database remotely.
I did already change setting at my.cnf --bind to address  to 0.0.0.0, 
but seems some firewall is active and 3306 is closed.
Where I can open this port?
I know this is potential security hole, but this can be fixed later.
Drazen
