## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I've been playing with the ability to give out fixed IP's to computer
accounts as well, in a "static" range (outside the normal DHCP) range. When
I get this to work nicely and reliably, I'll add it to the latest version.
At this stage though, it sounds like you've worked out a good enough
solution.
