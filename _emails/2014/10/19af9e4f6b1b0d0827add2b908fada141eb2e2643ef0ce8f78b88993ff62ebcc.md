## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Nightly builds goes to 14.0 only as I know.
Nightly builds are changing often, sometimes twice a night, and 
sometimes new build is buggy, some things are broken... this is how 
develop goes this way.

so, its hard to say what is wrong with your case. Who knows which build 
you pick up.

If you are newbie here, better download stabile version 3.7.7.11 from 
official site, and go with 12.04 ubuntu.

Old realteks working nice with me, or don't working at all.
