## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}As that install page says, the stable version is currently only supported
on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Debian 6. Debian 7 should also work.

Having said that, the errors you are getting suggest something is seriously
wrong with your install, as some of the packages it's talking about are
core ubuntu ones that shouldn't have any problem being installed.

The latest nightly release may work on 12.10, however support for 12.10 has
finished. You should try the stable version on 12.04, or the latest nightly
on 14.04.
