## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thanks for the addition Tim.
I need to probably Build a VM to start using nightly, just that i barely
have much time and thus wanted to wait until its at least RC level to jump
in.

This will help for me personally.
I usually have to ping the device and use tcpdump to capture its mac
address and thats kinda too much sometimes.
Depending on the situation sometimes they can supply their IP for whatever
reason but not their MAC.
