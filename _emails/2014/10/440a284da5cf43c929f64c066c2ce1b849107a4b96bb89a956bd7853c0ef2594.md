When you do a mass import, would you want to just import a list of
usernames, or usernames, passwords and comments? The rest of the settings
would be applied from a group at import time. I can certainly look at how
to do this.

Ideally, with the nightlies you'd now setup vouchers with first use
activation, and do generic vouchers. How important is it to print their
name on it?

This was one of the first use cases I added the batches for. With first use
activation, this is now more practical. I used to print out up to 500
tickets at a time for a cafe we run Grase in. Also, now that I've added
"Free Login" button, that reduces the number of tickets they require.

Pen? What Pen? :P

I'm hoping with the new ability to edit the CSS for printing, we can make
the labels fancier for normal printing. But if you need pixel perfect
layout (for example to print on to specific label paper) then you'll always
be better off with mailmerge software. If you are just printing on thin
card, with a colour printer and can tolerate when things aren't 100%
aligned, then the new CSS editing should be enough!
