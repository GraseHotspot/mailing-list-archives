## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Tcpdf and other PDF libraries are rather large for what they do. It's also
hard for someone to customise to get a pixel perfect layout. It was added
to allow printing onto mailing labels, which the CSV export and a mail
merge would be better at.
The next step for printing labels will be to simplify the CSS and make it
easy to customise the CSS. Then it'll be possible to generate a funky
"voucher" in CSS and HTML that doesn't have to be pixel perfect to match
some labels. You can still print the resulting page to PDF with your
browser for sending it by email.

Is it possible to do what you need with HTML or the CSV export? I've found
the tcpdf library very difficult to customise beyond the basics.

If the demand is there it's not hard to add back in, but I believe the HTML
and CSS option will be easier for more people to adapt.
