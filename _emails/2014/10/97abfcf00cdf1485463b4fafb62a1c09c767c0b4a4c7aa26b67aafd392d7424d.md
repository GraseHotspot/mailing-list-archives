## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}While there is lots I'd love to complete before the next release, not
everything needs to be done to produce a stable release.

One of the main things initially is the changed login form. I've tested it
on an old iPod touch, numerous android devices, and of course windows and
linux computers. If anyone is having problems logging in on the nightlies
builds with a device, please tell me.

Also, what more do people want to see on the status page after login? I've
tried to keep it simple, but knowing what people actually want displayed
will ensure I don't clutter it, or put lots of effort into something that's
not needed.

Other than that, what do people want to see finished before the next stable
release? (See
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/milestones/3.8 for what
was intended to be finished before the release).

I'm fairly happy with the stability of the nightlies at the moment, so
would be happy to start a release candidate once enough feedback is
received (and any changes to the login forms done).

Tim
