Let me analyze this case.
For the first time only you need to import the most pupils (K8 e.g.)

Once a year operations:
Every next year will be necessary to import new class 1 generation for 
the first time and kick out last class 8 which is finished and live school.
Now groups. I guess that defining groups as classes would be the best 
for easy control and overall import process. Here we have to move all 
class to next class from group to group. (Option is to assign group as a 
year e.g  2014 for group which starts this year with class1 and we never 
move them until they finish last class. So we treat them as "generation 
2014" no further shift necessary but maybe less practical )

I guess that import should have following fields:
username, comment, group
Group name, group limits should be defined before importing users guess.

Password should be generated by Grase. It would be out of mind to invent 
hundreds passwords.
username will be generated as short from name and surname,
Comment field should contain full Name+Surname of pupil how one can 
recognize each.

This case should be discussed more. It all depends on who is intended to 
do all of this maintenance.
For me, there is no problem. I can import pupils directly using phpMyAdmin
I bellieve that for beginning Grase admin is the person who will doing this.
