{% raw  %}Hi Wilsonpep

Due to the way SSL works (the S part of HTTPS), it's impossible to do
captive portal redirection on HTTPS links, unless you install your own CA
certificate on all client machines, something that is impossible for most
setups, and also not recommended due to the fact it means you can
impersonate any secure site.

Most OS's have "Captive Portal" detection. What this is, is that when you
first connect to a wireless network, the device will send out a specially
crafted HTTP request. If that request is caught by a captive portal (the
hotspot), it'll prompt the user to sign into the wireless network.

I do know that with iOS 7 and beyond, there may be issues with captive
portals on Apple devices. However, I don't have any of these devices to
test, and it's not an issue unique to the Grase Hotspot, but all captive
portals.

Regarding your Samsung device, you should find that within 2 minutes of
connecting to the WiFi, it should display a notification prompting to sign
into the wireless network.

Regards

Tim
