## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hi Bart

It's hard to know. I'm hoping weeks. Ideally I want everything in the 3.8
milestone finished (
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/milestones/3.8) however
I've been looking at it over the last few days and will probably bump some
things to the next release.

Realistically I need to finish the new login page and status dialogue
before the next release. They are most of the way there so I just need some
time to attack it for a whole day.

As I have a family and full time job, I don't get lots of time to work on
the hotspot. That's why lots of small features get done as it's easier to
work on them in the snippets of time I get.

Tim
