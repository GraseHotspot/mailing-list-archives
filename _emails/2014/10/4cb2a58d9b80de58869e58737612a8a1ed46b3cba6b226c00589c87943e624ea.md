## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}One year back I was also interested in online selling and charging 
customers. Something happened here in Croatia last year. Government 
introduced new law and infrastructure for realization of: every single 
cash or credit card transaction in physical shop, which normally 
printing invoice for every transaction, bill should be verified with tax 
central server, and then printed for customer. It means every single 
caffebar had to order internet connection and so called "fiscal cash 
machine" (PC or Tablet with appropriate software and certificates).
Well, tax is minor problem by selling internet access. The problem are 
numberless cafe bars with "free" internet. It become clear to all cafe 
owners that they have to offer free internet for their customers since 
they have line already, what they did. Typically they are using some 
protection and silly password like "12345". You only need to order your 
first drink in cafe or just ask for password.

Beside this, I have noticed trend in EU, free internet ("WiFi" type 
only) is spreading more and more. Probably there is more free APs now 
then payed ones.

And finally I\ufffdve read one study couple of years ago. It says that there 
is no way that anyone who is selling internet "at last mile" would ever 
make profit.
There is a lot of money spent on internet infrastructure before AP 
point. (Consider AP as last mile), so companies who did that are making 
huge profit already. Not you, not me, nor Tim.
Unfortunately, I have to agree with that fact.

I would like to hear more opinions about.
