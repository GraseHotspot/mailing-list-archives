{% raw  %}Hi Phil,

We are supporting grase in production environment also, and had to overcome those challenges too,
If you make a user with the variables that you want the self-sign up ones to have, look at the database tables for what it creates,

And then make a web form for creating the same variables also, I'd recommend using  www.easyclick.ch, they have a php examples in there for error checking, and a section which says send an email with examples, combine that using the mysql api to connect and insert http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/mysqlinfo.api.choosing.php

And you should be golden :-)

Subject: [GRASE-Hotspot] Self Registration

Hi,

I am currently using your wonderful system in a production environment and would like to allow users the ability to self register and pay for use through an online payment gateway.

Is there any way to allow users to self register, and if so, how do I accomplish this task?

Regards

Phill
