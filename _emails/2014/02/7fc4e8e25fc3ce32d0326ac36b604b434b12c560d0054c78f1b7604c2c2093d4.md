## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hey everyone

Currently the mailing list is hosted on SourceForge. I'm currently not
using SourceForge for anything but the mailing list, now that the code and
bug tracker are on GitHub.

I'm currently looking at moving to Google Groups (ether paid business ones,
or free ones, although I'm not sure the free ones do archives?). How do
people feel about this change? I can alternatively move to a self hosted
Mailman (I already host Mailman for another organisation). Part of my
thinking with Google Groups is that it's less work for me to host (and the
less time I spend on maintaining Grase services at the moment, the more
time I can actually work on Grase), and the fact that we also then get a
Web interface to the group for those who want a more Forum style interface.

Feedback requested!

Thanks

Tim
