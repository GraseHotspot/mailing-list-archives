## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi guys,

I've had a GRASE hotspot running for more than half a year now without any
issue.

Recently though there were complaints of the hotspot no longer working -
there were no changes to any part of the setup. The login interface would
no longer automatically show up for end users, i.e. the auto forward failed.

Upon investigation I found the server and admin interface worked, manually
accessing the login worked, logging in worked and after login it was also
possible to access websites by IP address, URLs however failed.

It seems like the DNS set my has gone offline, but simply changing to
another public DNS server (simply put into the web frontend and then
restart the machine) has not solved the problem. Does anyone have an idea?
When I ping an IP from the command prompt it comes back without issues,
URLs however fail. Where else do I need to set the DNS server?

Thanks in advance,

Benjamin
