## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Yes and No.

Yes, it's possible. Through the current UI, it's not. You can create a
special group called Machines (IIRC, will have to check in the source) that
will be applied to all computer accounts. Working from there, you can
create more groups for the computer accounts, then edit the DB to assign
them to those other groups.

Lastly, if you want, you can create a user directly as a computer account
by using the MAC address, and the special macpassword setting, again you'll
want to check in the code for the format of the MAC address (or check the
DB). There really isn't anything special about computer accounts except the
login is a MAC address, and the password is a special password. Just the UI
hides that from the user.

Patches welcome to unhide the complexity of computer accounts so they can
be more flexible.
