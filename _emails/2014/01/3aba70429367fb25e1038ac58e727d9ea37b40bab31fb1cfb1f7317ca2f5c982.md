## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi, 

I was wondering if it is possible (or could be possible) to allocate users accounts in a similar way to computer accounts but where we can take full advantage of the normal account features. 
Or maybe put another way - Allow computer accounts to have the same limits assigned as we do with user accounts.

Here is the use case: 

	Customer has normal casual guests 
		- They get issued usernames and passwords in the normal way 
		- They get a time limit and a data limit. 
		- This all works perfectly.

	Customer also has staff that live onsite. 
		- They can get internet too if they like at Staff rates. 
		- They get a data limit and their time limit is big (like 6-12 months) 
		- They need to pay for their data usage just like the casual guests but at a staff rate. 
		- We use different user groups for staff and guests.


The main issue is that the staff are getting annoyed at having to continually log in all the time. 
Whenever they roam off-site and back again they need to re-login. 
Some of them have devices that are unable to log in (like TiVo's etc).


The computer Account works fine for allowing designated computer access, but we do not get the same level of detail with the limits.

Can we create a computer account for each device that has: 
	- Bandwidth Limits
	- Recurring Data Limits
	- Expiry

Essentially, if it were possible to select an existing group that each computer account can belong to, that would meet the need. 

Thoughts?

Dave Wilson
