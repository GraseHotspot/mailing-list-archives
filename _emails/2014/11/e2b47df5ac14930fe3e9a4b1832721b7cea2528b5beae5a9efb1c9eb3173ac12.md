## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Nazanin

I've created an issue for the search bar.
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/116

Regarding the inheritance. It's been a tough decision as to how we do the
group data limits. The "inherit" from group isn't really inheriting, it's
taking the groups default at user account creation time. I've created an
issue to make it work both ways later on (
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/117). For now, the
only way to update your existing users is to learn SQL and write some
queries.
