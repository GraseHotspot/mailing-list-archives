## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}If I understand you correctly, you want to know how to upgrade your current
stable server to the nightly build? It is possible, you will need some
downtime, but it should be less than 10 minutes.

If you follow the steps (
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/wiki/Nightly-Builds) from
number 2, even though the command says "install", it'll update any existing
packages and you won't loose your users.
