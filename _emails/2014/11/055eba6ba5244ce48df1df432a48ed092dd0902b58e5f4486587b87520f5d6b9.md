## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hi Neonjohn,
I admit that your terminology regarding network devices fooling me a bit.
Satmodem  - this device should be a router actually. If it is not you 
should put one here at the very first network point in order to protect 
"home" network. This should act as router, gateway, DHCP, DNS, NAT, FW 
for your internal network.
If you said that NAS would be exposed there, so Lab-machine is exposed 
already.

HUB - haven't seen one since 10Mb/s networking. Guess it is a switch 
actually, but less important here.

Router which is acting as switch!? Well I see wasting the power here, 
and probably complicating set up. That something is missing in set up 
here is very likely. Pure switch will do a job without a doubt. What I 
am suspecting here is that your router-switch has to have LAN ports IP 
assigned as well. Also, all lans should be part of one vlan with single 
IP.  I am not sure if you can get it working as pure switch at all.

I can suggest you once again a bit modified suggestion. If there is no 
router at satmodem side, move your router (wich acts as switch now) at 
the SAT side. Connect it's wan to satmodem, and the rest of network to 
switch ports. Setup router to act as router,GW,DHCP,DNS,FW and connect 
NAS and GRASE to it. Your "HUB" move to Grase LAN side and you should go.

Let back to your main problem. When you were assigning manually static 
IP to NAS, have you assigned mask, gateway and DNS data as well. 
255.255.255.0   10.1.0.1   10.1.0.1   respectively.
If you did, I am very suspicious to your router-switch setup.

Suggestion for protected NAS,  look for "freenas" excellent freeBSD 
based distribution.
