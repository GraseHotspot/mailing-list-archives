## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Tim,

Basically, I would love to have something akin to the m0n0wall/pfsense 
interface for firewall rules and port forwards.
Currently, it seems like it should be behind another firewall or be 
managed from CLI regarding those functions.
One of the issues is that if I would add a separate tool locally on the 
hotspot to deal with this I assume this would make the two sets of rules 
crash.
This is not necessarily a deal-breaker, just curious as to what is possible.

Ah, of course, adding price to the name should be sufficient.
Smart solution =)

Thanks for the answer!

With my best regards
Klas
