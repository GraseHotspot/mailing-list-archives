## Raw message

{% raw  %}Hi Tim

I have done the preliminary tests and i am quite satisfied with the changes 
you have made Tim. This definitely solves all concerns i had. I created a 
machine account and i saw the new option to allocate to a group. All went 
smoothly. It works perfectly. Yes computers can now be managed via the 
groups. This means we can now allocate certain bandwidth restriction on 
machine accounts. Well done again.

I also noticed that session logs are back! This is great; thanks. I will 
continue running tests and give feedback where necessary.

Regards
Louis
