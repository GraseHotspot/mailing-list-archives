## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}This is something that I've been wanting to do for a long time. I
originally made computer accounts "special" due to the initial use case I
developed the Hotspot for.
As of the latest nightly, computers are no longer "special" other than the
fact they auto login.
https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues/111
They can be part of any group, and you can have groups with computers and
normal users. Essentially, any user with a MAC address as their username,
and the correct password, is a computer account.

We really need people to test these changes, so please test and give me
feedback!
