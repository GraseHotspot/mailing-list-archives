## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello guys,

First off, Thank you Tim for a wonderful package.  I provide both free
and paid internet access via satellite to this remote fishing resort.
I've been using DD-WRT but had no control over bandwidth hogs.  Grase is
a breath of fresh air.

I'm having a couple of problems that I don't know how to resolve.  My
architecture is as follows:

                                                 +--AP
satmodem----lab machine running grase---router---+--My Linux desktop
                                                 +--NAS
                                                 +--laptop

I have the DHCP range set from 10 to 254.  The NAS is the repository for
all my business and personal data.  It must have a fixed address for NFS
to work.  I currently have it assigned the static address of 10.1.0.253.

The problem is that I can't reach the NAS from the lab/Grase machine.
No connection and no ping.  I've tried moving it to within the specified
DHCP range to 10.1.0.253 but that made no difference.

This brings up the more general question.  DD-WRT had the concept of
reserved DHCP addresses which would assign the specified IP address to a
given MAC address.  That let me keep all my machines set to DHCP -
including the NAS - while ensuring that when they're on my network they
always have the same IP address.  I want to achieve that same
functionality in Grase.

I'm an experienced Linux programmer and user but not so strong on
networking.

I looked at /etc/dnsmasq.conf I find what appears to do what I need.
There is this section:

## Always allocate the host with Ethernet address 11:22:33:44:55:66
# The IP address 192.168.0.60
#dhcp-host=11:22:33:44:55:66,192.168.0.60


Which appears to do just what I want.  I want my Linux machine to always
be 10.1.0.100 so I entered the line

dhcp-host=78:45:c4:31:37:1b,10.1.0.100

I then restarted dnsmasq with

$ sudo /etc/rc.d/dnsmasq restart

Which succeeded.

I then released and requested the DHCP address

$ sudo dhclient -r eth4 && sudo dhclient eth4

eth4 being the ethernet port on this machine.

$ ifconfig still shows

eth4      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 78:45:c4:31:37:1b
          inet addr:10.1.0.11  Bcast:10.1.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::7a45:c4ff:fe31:371b/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:9147993 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:8457221 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
          RX bytes:3670533484 (3.6 GB)  TX bytes:1704326715 (1.7 GB)
          Interrupt:46 Base address:0x2000

I then tried rebooting this machine which resulted in the same 10.1.0.11
address being assigned to it.

So apparently dnsmasq isn't being used by Grase.  Is that correct?

So what does Grase use to assign DHCP addresses?  Can I achieve my goal
of having reserved DHCP addresses?

Thanks,
John
