## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hello All :

Thank you Tim for the great software and everyday developments
I am using the software on one university with more than 300 users who
connect to the software everyday.
The problem is :
I have created different groups such as teachers , student, staff , ....
some reasons make me change the data and time limits , is there any way to
apply this change to all existing users ? applying this change user by user
is very difficult as in a university the members are more than 300 .

also one suggestion I have is adding a search bar in the users page ,
especially when the numbers are high finding a specific user in a sepcific
page is very difficut.
Thank you again
Nazanin behroozian
{% endraw %}
