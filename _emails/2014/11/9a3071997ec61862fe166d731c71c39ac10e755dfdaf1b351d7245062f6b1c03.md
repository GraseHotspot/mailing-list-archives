## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Minor update to the Freeradius package in the nightly. Previously, if you
had multiple "limits", they could conflict. i.e. If you had a recurring
daily limit, and a fixed total limit, depending on the order in configs,
you could get more than you should for a time period.
The correct behaviour is that you get the most restrictive limit out of all
the limits. e.g. If you have a daily limit of 10 minutes, but a total limit
of 20 minutes, you are restricted to 10 minutes for today. If you have a
daily limit of 20 minutes, but a total limit left of 10 minutes, you would
only get 10 minutes for today.

Please test all your limits work as you expect them to.

Regards

Tim
