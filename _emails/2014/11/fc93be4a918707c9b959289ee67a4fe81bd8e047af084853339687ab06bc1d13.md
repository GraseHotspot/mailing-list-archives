## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Thanks for your reply TIM.


As grase grow I believe there will be more and more request similar what 
what I've asked above. I believe this is the networking model that will be 
most likely used in most areas. Im not really a programmer, im from the old 
pascal c and asm days, with little time right now to learn new tools.


it would be good to implement the mode for grase to work in routed 
environments versus flat Lans. NATted lans might not be easy as only the 
device that does the NAT would authenticate but then i believe this would 
be a desired outcome anyways. This could be a configuration setting.

I'll try my best to provide whatever help I can to achieve this.
