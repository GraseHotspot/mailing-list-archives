I actually have a 4 port hub between the sat modem and the lab machine.
 I put that in so I could sniff the satmodem stream to find the
bandwidth hogs before I discovered Grase.  So it won't be a big deal to
move the NAS as you suggest.  The only problem is that security on the
NAS is practically non-existent so I don't want it exposed to the net.

I really need to get to the root of the problem and get the lab machine
to properly deal with static addresses.

The router in my diagram is really an 8 port switch.  I don't make a
whole lot of distinction between the two when I'm not using the WAN port
of the router - they do essentially the same thing.

I didn't draw my whole network which includes several more laptops plus
the laptop of a long term guest.  We want them to stay DHCP so that they
don't have to be tinkered with when one of them leaves the house and
connects to another hotspot.  But we also want them to always have the
same IP address when on my net.  The reserved DHCP functionality is
exactly what we need - we just need to figure out how to achieve it.

I still haven't figured out where to start looking.  Any tips would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
John
