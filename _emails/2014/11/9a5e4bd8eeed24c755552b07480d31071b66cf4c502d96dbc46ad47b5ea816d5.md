## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi Alan

You are welcome to express wishes and ideas in the list. It gives others a
chance to add to the conversation which can help gauge demand for a feature.

The first request is probably fairly trivial. The second slightly harder
but still fairly easy. Please open issues for them on Github and I'll look
into them after this release. (

Thanks

Tim
