## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}I'm wondering if it is possible to do some sort of 'password of the 
day/week' and have it mailed to me rather than having to login and do the 
same thing every day.

We just need one guest user account allowing multiple users but time 
limited to say one day or one week.

I figured it must be possible to add this direct to the database and was 
thinking of trying to write a bit of code and sticking it on a cron.

I was looking at the 'newuser.php' file for some clues on doing this.

Any suggestions or guidance ?
