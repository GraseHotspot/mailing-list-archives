Sorry to reply twice, but a further problem in this regard is that I 
cannot get my hotspot server to see the static ip addresses.
By "see" I mean that I cannot ping them nor can I scp to them (from the 
server).

I particularly need the static IP addresses so that I can scp files from 
the server to the client machines (via PHP).

Thanks again,
