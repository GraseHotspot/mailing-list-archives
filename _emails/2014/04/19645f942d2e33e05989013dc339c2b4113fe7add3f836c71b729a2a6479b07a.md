## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi

I can ping my DHCP-clients from my Grase Hotspot server, but I cannot 
ssh into them.
 From Grase I can ssh into other upstream machines, just not the 
DHCP-clients.
The DHCP-clients are fully accessible by ssh from other DHCP-client 
machines in my network.
I've tried a few Google remedies without success.

Anyone have any ideas?
