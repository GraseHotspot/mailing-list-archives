The DNS (from resolv.conf) is 10.1.0.1 and the gateway is correctly set 
to 10.1.0.1.
I am doing this via the command line as the clients have old versions of 
Ubuntu on them with buggy network managers, so I simply run the 
following in /etc/rc.local:

     dhclient -r
     ifconfig eth0 10.1.0.241 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 10.1.0.255
     route add default gw 10.1.0.1

Obviously I make it 242 for the next machine, etc.

In order to make it work in the interim I have simply set them back to 
DHCP and added an alias for the desired static IP address.
These are machines that I have had working with DHCP for ages.

By "complete settings" what do you mean?

Thanks,
Tim2
