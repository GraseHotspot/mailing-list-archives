## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Hi is there any way to disable logging?
Because If I want to use grase in a Hotel for example, it is against the 
law if I log the sites the user visited.
I know that there is a access.log from squid3, where all the things are 
stored.
When I delete the file, the server recreates it with the next start. 
If I change the permissions, so that the file is not write able and 
restart, you can't access the Internet through Grase anymore.
So is there anyway to disable logs?
By the way, when I remove the access.log, I can still see, when user where 
online, can I disable this function, too?
Sry for my english.
