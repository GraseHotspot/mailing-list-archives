## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}Well I am back hauling internet to an island.


so the way it was setup was:

internet -> router -> switch -> wireless device (across a body of water) to 
receiving wireless device -> several routers serving DHCP (192.168.20.x, 
192.168.30.x, 192.168.40.x depends on the part of the island they are on) 
-> wireless access points.

I replaced the router to the internet with the grase server.  But it 
appears I can no longer get past the routers on the Island.  I cannot 
administer the box on the local ip as well.  So like I said I am weak in 
networking part an not sure what configuration changes I need to make.  I 
currently have a test setup I am working on to see if I can fix it.
