First make sure you read this ALL the way to the bottom :

http://grasehotspot.org/documentation/installation/

In particular here :

http://grasehotspot.org/documentation/installation/#comment-3413

and here :

http://grasehotspot.org/documentation/installation/#comment-3430

Yes, you can access the admin page from anywhere, as long as you know the 
WAN IP address.

Your setup with switch and cable modem sounds OK - just need to make sure 
you get the right settings with the cable modem ~ server. You could still 
have used your router - either with the LAN set to DHCP or set statically 
if you prefer. Really depends on what you want to achieve.
