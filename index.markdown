# Grase Hotspot Mailing List Archives

## Basic information
These are the archives for the [Grase Hotspot](https://grasehotspot.org) Mailing list that ran from 2011 to 2023.

Emails have been masked to reduce spam, and as not all list members may have realised that archives are public, as Google Groups didn't make this obvious. Google also masked emails for the public archives.

Generation of these archives has been done from a Google Takeout of the Google Group (which had previously had the Mailman archives imported).

The code used to parse the mailing list archives was adapated from [https://github.com/tombusby/cypherpunk-mailing-list-archive-parser](https://github.com/tombusby/cypherpunk-mailing-list-archive-parser) which is used for the Cypherpunks Mailing List Archive. Our modified version of the code can be found at [https://github.com/GraseHotspot/mailing-list-archives-parser](https://github.com/GraseHotspot/mailing-list-archives-parser) and the Jekyll site generator can be found at [https://github.com/GraseHotspot/mailing-list-archives](https://github.com/GraseHotspot/mailing-list-archives)
